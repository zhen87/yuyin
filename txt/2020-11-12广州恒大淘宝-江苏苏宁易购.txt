
 大家非常清楚
 You know very well. 
 我们两支球队的技战术风格是
 Our two teams have very different styles of play. 
 截然不同的
 踢球的方式是截然不同的
 The way you play football is very different. 
 所以说是第1回合的比赛
 So its the first round. 
 我们有机会取得进球
 We had chances to score. 
 但是
 But 
 没有很好地把握住
 Not holding it very well. 
 所以说我是希望今晚这个比赛
 So I hope there will be a certain change in this game 
 能有一定的这个改变
 tonight. 
 当然两支球队都是非常强强
 Of course
 both teams are very strong teams. 
 的球队
 谁想在今晚上胜出
 Who wants to win tonight? 
 那都是要付出很大的努力
 Thats a lot of hard work. 
 很大的这种代价
 Thats a big price to pay. 
 所以说
 So say. 
 还是说今天晚上的比赛
 Or is it tonights game? 
 我希望我的球队能够像往常一样
 I hope my team will continue to perform as well as 
 保持好的表现
 usual. 
 其实在今天的决赛
 In fact
 in todays final. 
 两队都是有关键球员的缺失
 Both teams are missing key players. 
 我们先来看看江苏苏宁够今天的
 Lets take a look at Jiangsu Sunings tactics today. 
 手法
 首发阵容和首回合相比的是
 The starting line-up was three changes from the first 
 换三个人
 leg. 
 李昂停赛
 Suspended from Li Ang 
 由杨博宇入T
 By Yang Boyu into T 
 卜杜海米提解禁复出取代
 Bu Duhaimiti returns from suspension to replace Gao 
 高天意
 Tianyi 
 另外谢鹏飞先发登场
 In addition
 Xie Pengfei will start first. 
 取代罗竞
 Substitution Luo Jing 
 从阵型图来看
 From the formation diagram
 
 今天有可能会打这个5后卫的
 Could be in the back fives consulting room today. 
 诊室
 加强这个防守
 Strengthen this defense. 
 同时对场地的宽度是格外
 At the same time
 the width of the site is particularly 
 注重
 important. 
 这是首回合交手的时候
 This is the time for the first round. 
 我们来关注一下江苏苏宁易购
 Lets take a look at Jiangsu Suning Easy-to-buy in 
 在防守端呈现出的相当清晰的
 the defensive end of the show quite clearly. 
 站位和防守效果
 Positional and defensive effects 
 厄的确
 Er
 indeed. 
 在首场比赛当中
 In the first game. 
 虽然说苏宁易购的射门不
 Although Suning Easy-to-buys shooting is not much. 
 多
 但是广州恒大在整个进攻
 But Guangzhou Evergrande did not present Su Ning with 
 中的没有给苏宁带去特别多
 a particularly substantial threat throughout the attack. 
 的实质性的威胁
 这恐怕是跟着苏宁易购它整体
 Im afraid this is following the overall defense of 
 的防守
 Suning Easy-to-buy. 
 无论是前场的逼抢
 Whether its up front or closing down. 
 中场的这种阵型的紧凑
 The compactness of midfields formation 
 还是后方后场的相互的协防补
 Or is it the mutual defense complement of the rear 
 位
 the defensive third? 
 都做得比较到家
 Have done a better job. 
 他两个前锋有的时候位置顶得
 His two forward are sometimes on top of each other. 
 比较靠上
 这样迫使
 This compels 
 广州恒大淘宝的由中尉或者是
 The Guangzhou Evergrande Taobaos first lieutenant 
 门将起长传球来发动攻势
 or goalkeeper starts the attack with a long pass. 
 但他们在江苏苏宁易购半场第
 But they were very difficult to get the ball at the 
 1点想拿球的都非常困难
 first point of Jiangsu Sunings half. 
 在边路是非常注重对
 The side is very focused on the Evergrande wing half-back 
 恒大边前卫边后卫
 full back. 
 边路进攻的这种抑制和延缓
 This inhibition and delay of flank attacks 
 应当说90分钟比赛
 It should be said that 90 minutes of competition 
 江苏苏宁易购的这个防守是做
 Jiangsu Suning Easy-to-buys defense is to achieve 
 到一个极致
 an extreme. 
 呈现的相当的出色
 Presented quite well. 
 当然恒大本身它的确具有着
 Of course
 Evergrande itself does have a lot of excellent. 
 非常多的优秀的
 球员
 Player 
 他们在局部往往通过个人能力或者
 They are often partially transmitted through personal 
 两三个人相互之间默契的传导
 ability or tacit understanding between two or three 
 people. 
 就能够给对手的制造足够的
 You can make enough of a threat to your opponent. 
 威胁
 对
 Yes 
 所以今天的苏宁易购在里昂缺阵
 So todays Suning easy to buy in the absence of Lyon 
 的情况下
 排除后卫我认为还是比较
 I think its safer to rule out the guards. 
 稳妥的
 因为毕竟如果是四后卫
 Because after all
 if its a back four
 
 杨博宇跟里昂的对位的这种
 This substitution of Yang Boyu and Lyons counterpoint 
 顶替
 那恐怕会给后防线埋下一些影子
 Im afraid that will cast a shadow over the defence. 
 是广州恒大淘宝今天的先发
 Yeah
 Guangzhou Evergrande Taobaos starting lineup 
 阵容和4天前相比是
 today compared to four days ago. 
 换两个人
 For two people. 
 首先塔利斯卡今天首发登场
 First of all
 Talisca starts today. 
 换下的是美食号
 The change is the gourmet number. 
 另外何超解禁复出
 In addition
 the He Chao is back. 
 T下受伤的郑智
 INJURED Zheng Zhi UNDER T 
 郑智今天是不在比赛的大名单
 Zheng Zhi is not in the squad for the game. 
 当中
 433阵型
 4-3-3 formation 
 保利尼奥
 Paulinho 
 何超和徐新搭档在中场出现
 He Chao and Xu Xin paired up in midfield 
 其实何超跟徐新在最近的比赛中
 In fact
 he Chao and Xu Xin in the recent game. 
 两个人联袂登场的时候效果是
 The effect is good when two people appear together. 
 不错的
 应该说如果没记错
 It should be said that if you remember correctly
 
 这个阵容就是第2回合在半决赛
 This lineup is what it was in the second round when 
 打关的时候这个回合所
 the semifinals were played. 
 上场的11人的首发
 The first of the 11 players who came on. 
 这是
 This is 
 艾克森在拉到边路之后
 After Elkeson pulled to the side
 
 给后排插上的韦世豪做球这场
 Play the game for the Wei Shihao in the back row 
 比赛
 其实这样的组合在对江苏苏宁
 In fact
 such a combination in the first half of Jiangsu 
 易购上半场呈现2~3次
 Suning Easy-to-buy 2 to 3 times. 
 都是有一定的威胁
 Theres a certain amount of threat. 
 这一次是最突出的
 This one is the most prominent. 
 左脚打门稍微偏一点
 The left-footed shot is a little bit wide. 
 但是今天韦世豪是坐在
 But Wei Shihao is on the bench today. 
 替补席上
 可能对于双方主要主教练来讲
 Maybe for the two main coaches. 
 逐渐的随着比赛的推进
 Gradually as the game progressed. 
 他认识到一些队员
 He realized that some of the players 
 似乎替补会比首发作用更大
 It seems that the bench will be more useful than the 
 你比如说这个恒大的韦世豪
 For example
 the Wei Shihao of this Evergrande. 
 你比如说苏宁易购的罗竞
 For example
 the Luo Jing of Suning Easy-to-buy. 
 他们在上一回合都是首发出场
 They both started the last round. 
 而这一回合就坐在替补席
 And this round is on the bench. 
 上
 竞在半决赛是作出突出的贡献
 To compete in the semi-final is to make an outstanding 
 contribution. 
 在
 At 
 决赛的首回合是先发登场
 The first leg of the final is the start. 
 但他是第1个被换下
 But he was the first to be replaced. 
 是的
 Yes 
 韦世豪在首回合当中打
 Wei Shihao played 86 minutes in the first leg and was 
 86分钟被塔利斯卡换下
 replaced by Talisca 
 塔利斯卡上一轮首回合
 In the first leg of the last round in Talisca
 it was 
 它基本上没怎打
 basically nothing. 
 所以应该说阳精蓄锐
 So it should be said that Yang essence is stored up. 
 主教练的这个卡纳瓦罗对
 The coachs Cannavaro seems to have a soft spot for 
 塔利斯卡似乎情有独钟
 Talisca. 
 是
 Yes 
 那场比赛其实张林鹏发挥非常
 In fact
 Zhang Linpeng played very well in that game. 
 不错
 攻守两端都呈现出非常高
 Both ends of the court are showing very high standards. 
 的水准
 希望在今天能打出同样的
 I hope to play with the same high quality today. 
 高素质来
 保利尼奥这个球没有船
 The ball of Paulinho has no boat. 
 后来有的媒体认为这可能是
 Later
 some media believe that this may be Evergrandes 
 恒大最有可能破门的一次机会
 most likely to break an opportunity. 
 徐新应该说还是清晰的去找
 The Xu Xin should be clear to find Baoling medicine. 
 宝灵药
 因为从外侧有
 Because from the outside. 
 这个费南多在前插
 This Fernando is inserted in front. 
 保利尼奥的什非常有利
 What is very advantageous in Paulinho 
 就是稍微偏一点
 Just a little bit more wide 
 再来看这是恒大队在进攻端
 Again
 this is Evergrande on the offensive end. 
 费南多内切之后
 After the Fernando has been cut inside 
 直接打完
 Straight through. 
 没有寻找队友是打偏
 Not Looking for teammates is playing wide. 
 顾超应该说在首回合
 Gu Chao had a good save to make in the first leg 
 有一个精彩的扑救
 在
 At 
 曾经有过失误的情况下
 There have been cases of mistakes. 
 似乎现在逐渐地变得更加成熟
 It seems to be becoming more mature and stable gradually 
 和稳健
 now. 
 而且非常的自信
 And very confident. 
 那其实说到这两支球队的交手
 In fact
 when it comes to the game between these two 
 teams
 
 虽然从纸面实力上来说
 Although in terms of paper strength
 
 广州恒大是占据优势的一方
 Guangzhou Evergrande is the dominant side. 
 但是在过往的两个赛季
 But in the last two seasons
 
 如果说哪支球队真正的从比赛结果
 If any team is really from the level of results. 
 层面
 可以和广州恒大相匹敌的
 That can compete with Guangzhou Evergrande. 
 其实就是将苏宁易购在过往两
 In fact
 it is the record of Suning Easy-to-buy in 
 个赛季的交手的这样的一个战绩
 the past two seasons. 
 上来说
 其实还是不错的
 Its actually pretty good. 
 那首回合又是双方战成0:
 The first leg was 0-0 again. 
 0
 感觉颇有一些
 It feels a little bit. 
 好像这种打法稍微有些相制的
 It seems that this kind of play has a little sense 
 感觉
 of phase. 
 对
 Yes 
 这个回合不这个赛季的第一
 This round is not the first phase of the season. 
 阶段
 双方就1胜1负
 The two sides are 1 win and 1 loss. 
 都是2:2.一场胜
 Both are 2:2 wins. 
 卡纳瓦罗刚才接受采访的时候话中有话
 There was something in Cannavaros interview just now. 
 他说我们两个队是截然不同的
 He said our two teams are very different. 
 风格
 就在某种程度上他会认为
 In a way
 he would think. 
 恒大的风格可能更开放一些
 Mr Evergrandes style may be more open. 
 那苏宁易购的风格可能更
 Then Sunings style may be more defensive and counter-attacking. 
 防守反击一些
 但事实上教练的这种表达有
 But in fact
 the coachs expression has two meanings. 
 两层含义
 一层含义就是
 One implication is that. 
 要让世人知道我们踢得是更似乎
 We want to let the world know that we are playing football 
 是更漂亮的足球
 seems to be more beautiful. 
 第二一个似乎是在显示着
 The second one seems to show some concern about his 
 自己对于对手的某种担心
 opponent. 
 他其实与其说你对手是这种风格
 Hes actually not so much your opponents style. 
 他不如说咱俩一个风格
 He might as well say we are the same style. 
 但是任何一个对
 But any one of them. 
 他用什样的战术打法呈现
 What kind of tactics does he use? 
 首先是结合着你
 The first is to combine you. 
 这个对有什样的队员
 What kind of player does this pair have? 
 如果卡纳瓦罗手上是江苏苏宁
 If the Cannavaro is a member of Jiangsu Suning Easy-to-buy 
 易购的队员
 那我想可能他会同样选择
 Then I think maybe he will choose the same. 
 一致的风格
 Consistent Style 
 防守反击没有什错误
 What is wrong with counterattacking? 
 其实06年他意大利获世界杯
 In fact
 he won the World Cup in Italy in 2006. 
 的冠军
 他们是获世界足球先生
 They are the World Player of the Year. 
 但那个时候意大利的足球实际上
 But at that time Italian football was actually defensive 
 是防守反击保守唉是这样
 and defensive and conservative. 
 说到防守
 Speaking of defense. 
 其实因为这场比赛香蕉上
 In fact
 because of the elimination match of two rounds 
 两个回合的这样的淘汰赛
 of bananas in this game. 
 应该说在很多杯赛的比赛里边
 It should be said that in many cup competitions. 
 这种淘汰赛的比赛似乎感觉好像
 This elimination match of the game seems to feel like 
 是姿态
 a gesture. 
 可能更保守
 Probably more conservative. 
 姿态更低
 Lower Attitude 
 做好防守的一方其实获得胜利的
 In fact
 the defensive side has a good chance of winning. 
 几率还是挺大的
 所以今天这场决赛两位老师可
 So todays finals are predictable for the two teachers. 
 预见的
 就是说将苏宁易购方面是不是还
 That is to say
 will Suning Easy-to-buy continue the 
 会延续上一场比赛
 last game? 
 这个防守姿态
 This defensive stance. 
 好像过去有一个传统说法
 It seems that there used to be a traditional saying 
 在杯赛要拿冠军
 To win the cup. 
 还是要靠防守
 Its still about defense. 
 今年的这个联赛恰恰有这样
 This years league just has such a nature. 
 一个性质
 在争冠组它实际上就是这种淘汰赛
 In the championship group
 it is actually this elimination 
 match. 
 排名赛背菜的形式
 The form of a ranking tournament. 
 对
 Yes 
 但是这个防守现在不是说
 But this defense is not talking about losing the ball 
 一丢球
 now. 
 马上都回到本方半场
 Everybody back in your own half now. 
 其实像苏宁易购它很多的防守
 In fact
 like Suning
 a lot of its defense is combined. 
 是结合的
 有高位的逼抢
 A high closing down. 
 有中场的压迫
 There is midfield of oppression. 
 如果说对方冲破
 If the other side breaks through. 
 你的中场
 Your midfield. 
 那必然会回到这个本方的
 That will inevitably return to the defensive area of 
 防守区域
 this side. 
 你看这是在高位
 You see
 this is high up. 
 对
 Yes 
 因为恒大他在后场处理球
 Because of Evergrande
 he handles the ball in the defensive 
 实话说有的时候并不是很
 To be honest
 sometimes its not. 
 严谨
 Precise 
 你比如说他比较年轻的左后卫
 For example
 he is a young left back. 
 这个吴少聪或者是朴志洙
 This Wu Shaocong or Park Ji-Su. 
 包括中场的何超和徐新他们
 Including midfield
 He Chao and Xu Xin. 
 有的时候在压迫的情况下
 Sometimes under pressure
 
 受迫的情况下
 Under duress 
 他们往往有的时候会有一定的
 They often make some mistakes sometimes. 
 失误
 所以如果说前场能够断下球
 So if the front court can steal the ball
 
 来
 直接A特尔和特谢拉就地发动反击
 Direct ater and Teixeira to strike back on the spot. 
 两三个人搞定不是说不可能
 Its not impossible that two or three people can do 
 对
 Yes 
 你看同样还是高位
 You see
 its also high. 
 这不能算作特高位
 This is not a particularly high position. 
 但是绝对不是说让你就能够长期
 But that doesnt mean youre going to be in our half 
 植入的进入我方半场
 for the long haul. 
 这就转化
 This translates into. 
 所以在逼抢的时候都已经去逼
 So when closing down
 they have to force the goalkeeper. 
 门将
 一般来讲对方只能是大脚的
 Generally speaking
 the other side can only be the 
 前端
 front of the big foot. 
 像这样的门将大脚向前
 Goalkeepers like this go forward with big feet 
 他
 He 
 准确的这个
 Exactly this. 
 进攻投入就会大打折扣
 Offensive input will be greatly reduced. 
 这是显示着多名的苏宁易
 This is showing more than the famous Suning Yi Gou 
 购的队员在前场给予对手压迫
 players in the frontcourt to give the opponent oppression. 
 又迫使恒大是长传打长传之后
 And forced Evergrande to follow long passs long pass 
 2点球的控制方面
 2. Control of penalty kicks 
 苏宁易购中场的人相对
 There are more people in Suning Easy-to-buy midfield. 
 多一些
 所以这场比赛对于恒大来讲
 So this is a game for Evergrande. 
 我认为最关键的还是某一种这个
 I think the most important thing is a certain kind 
 变化
 of change. 
 就如果说你一味的在中后场的
 Its possible if you are always in the middle of the 
 组织很有可能的
 backcourt. 
 会被抢断
 Will be stolen. 
 那结合这转移结合这个人的
 Then combine this transfer with this persons breakthrough. 
 突破
 多点的进攻应该是恒大能够
 A multi-point attack should be the key for Evergrande 
 发挥自身优势的关键的地方
 to play to its strengths 
 感谢两位老师对战术层面的
 Thank the two teachers for their interpretation and 
 一个解读和分析
 analysis of the tactical level. 
 相信在比赛的直播过程中
 I believe that during the live broadcast of the game
 
 两位老师会释放出更多的关于
 The two teachers will release more about the game.
