看看我们前方的记者潘冲
 Look at our reporter Pan Chong ahead. 
 那他是在这个苏州体育中心
 Then he was on the field of the Suzhou Sports Center. 
 的场内
 今天同样国安是有很多的球迷
 There are also a lot of fans in GuoAn today. 
 在现场
 我们来跟随小潘一起来看看
 Lets follow Xiao Pan and see how the atmosphere at 
 现场的气氛怎样
 the scene is. 
 唉潘总你好
 Hello
 Manager Pan. 
 那现在能够感受到场内的
 So now you can feel the inside. 
 苏州
 Suzhou 
 你让我感受到场内的气氛非常的
 You make me feel the atmosphere in the stadium is very 
 热烈
 warm. 
 我们首先想来问一问潘重
 We first want to ask Pan Zhong. 
 那北京国安在这场比赛第2
 Is there anything special about Beijing GuoAns preparation 
 回合的赛前备战有没有一些特别
 for the second leg of this game? 
 之处
 另外队内的气氛怎样
 Besides
 whats the mood like inside the team? 
 有的有的
 Yes
 yes. 
 那我现在所在的位置就是在
 Then I am now in the Suzhou Sports Center. 
 苏州市体育中心
 那说到国安这一周的备战
 Speaking of GuoAns preparation this week 
 其实在技战术训练与上一周
 In fact
 the technical and tactical training is not 
 是没有太大的区别的
 much different from the previous week. 
 并且可以看得出来球队的这个
 And you can see that in the team. 
 训练内容
 Training Content 
 包括它的一个首发阵容与上
 Including one of its starting lineups
 is not that 
 一次都没有太大的差别
 different from the last one. 
 除这个奥古斯托的这个差别
 Except for this difference between Augusto. 
 那其实管还说明国安这周
 In fact
 it also shows that GuoAn still maintains a 
 还是保持一个以我为主的态度
 self-centered attitude this week. 
 不过其实更多地增加是一些恢复
 But in fact
 more increase is some restorative training. 
 性的训练
 那恢复性的训练他的这个效果
 The effect of his restorative training is mainly reflected 
 就主要体现在奥古斯托和张
 in Augusto and Zhang Xizhe. 
 稀哲的身上
 那今天我们看到奥古斯托是
 So today we see Augusto is finally back from injury. 
 终于伤愈复出
 回到首发阵容当中
 Back in the starting line-up 
 那另外张稀哲是因为它目前
 In addition
 Zhang Xizhe is because his current physical 
 的体能还不足以支撑他打满全场
 strength is not enough to support him for the whole 
 game. 
 因此热能效今天是将它放在
 So thermal efficiency is the place to put it on the 
 替补席的位置
 bench today. 
 希望他能够在后半段的比赛当中
 Lets hope he shows up as a cavalryman in the second 
 作为一个骑兵出现
 half. 
 那说到伤病
 Well
 speaking of injuries. 
 其实球队目前的唯一的一个伤员
 In fact
 the only injured person in the team at present 
 可能就是侯永永乐
 may be Hou Yongyong. 
 那侯永永最近是因为髌骨的
 Hou Yongyong recently because of a ligament in the 
 内的一个韧带的老毛病又复发
 patella of the recurrence of the old problem. 
 所以说球队决定在这场比赛过后
 So the team decided to send her back to Europe for 
 将她送回欧洲去进行手术治疗
 surgery after this game. 
 那就意味着黄勇对于本赛季接下来
 That means Huang Yong may not be available for the 
 国安的比赛可能就是无缘
 rest of the season in GuoAn 
 那现场的一个情况大概是
 One of the situations on the scene is probably like 
 这样这样是一个国安的备战
 this
 which is the preparation of a GuoAn. 
 其实国安的备战其实在这个这
 In fact
 GuoAns preparation actually increased a little 
 场比赛之前还增加一点
 before this game. 
 那就是淘汰赛不可
 Thats the knockout. No. 
 非常常见的一个点球大战
 A very common penalty shootout 
 那对于点球轻声的效益进行
 That is a certain amount of training for the benefit 
 一定的一定的训练
 of soft penalty kick. 
 那热销在形容自己对于颠球
 The hot seller described his training for the ball. 
 的训练的时候
 他其实用一个非常有意思的
 He used a very interesting word. 
 词
 就是
 Namely 
 象征性地练一下
 Practise symbolically. 
 为什他会这说
 Why would he say that? 
 那首先其实他认为自己的球队
 First of all
 he actually thinks his team is capable 
 是有能力在90
 of 90. 
 分钟内把这个比赛是打破平局的
 To break the game open in minutes. 
 那另一方面她最重要的是他认为
 On the other hand
 the most important thing for her 
 球队的这个
 is what he thinks about the team. 
 在训练场上的点头训练与在赛场
 Nodding on the training pitch is nothing like this 
 上的这个点球大战是完全不一样
 penalty shootout on the field. 
 他认为
 He thinks. 
 在赛场上的压力是有助于球员去
 The pressure on the field is to help the players to 
 激发出自己的求胜欲
 inspire their desire to win. 
 所以说他更相信自己的球员在
 So he is more convinced that his players are really 
 真正面临的
 facing. 
 点球大战的时候
 In the penalty shootout. 
 能够发挥出自己最好的状态
 To be able to play their best state. 
 以上是国安球队的一个备战流畅
 Thats one of GuoAns more fluid preparations. 
 好的
 All right 
 谢谢潘总
 Thank you
 Manager Pan. 
 非常详细的内容
 Very detailed content. 
 我们再多问一句
 Lets ask one more question. 
 那今天国安现场大概有多少
 How many fans are there in GuoAn today? 
 球迷到场
 今天来到现场的事大概有500
 There are probably over 500 fans here today. 
 多名球迷
 其实对于国安球迷来说
 In fact
 for GuoAn fans
 
 这场比赛能来是一定要
 This game can come is a must. 
 因为如果这场比赛被淘汰
 Because if this game is eliminated
 
 那关就等于要退出争冠组
 That would mean dropping out of the title race. 
 那另外今天其实国安俱乐部特别
 In addition
 in fact
 GuoAn Club is specially prepared 
 为国安球迷准备
 for GuoAn fans today. 
 这个麦当劳的晚餐
 This McDonalds dinner. 
 是安慰他们旅途的一个疲惫
 Is to comfort them from a tiring journey. 
 另外是更加有助于球迷在场上
 In addition
 it is more helpful for fans to cheer for 
 更好的为国安去加油
 Guoan better on the field. 
 好的
 All right 
 麦当劳的力量
 The Power of McDonalds 
 谢谢帆丑
 Thanks
 Fan Chou. 
 那现在给我们带场内的
 Well
 its hard to bring us the latest information 
 最新的信息辛苦
 in the field now. 
 好的好的
 那是感谢潘总给我们带来很多
 的内容
 在这里要案例
 各位穷朋友们
 我们看球聊球要两不误扫码
 就可以立即加入我们pp体育
 国安球迷的阵营
 解国安的相关资讯
 大家肯定有关心山东鲁能
 今天赛前有一些什样的准备
 工作
 其实相较北京国安
 我们看到商路今天的首发还是
 有一定的调整幅度
 而且像鲁能上一场比赛其实在
 上半场踢得更好的一方
 那这场比赛对于他们来说又
 有一些什样的备战的心情
 还有一些关键球员的付出
 比如说莫伊塞斯他到底体能能够
 承受多少分钟的一个情况
 可能更多的信息我们要通过我们
 We may have more information to explain through our 
 的前方记者孙瑞来解一下
 front reporter Sun Rui. 
 他现在同样是在场
 He is also present now. 
 内梁老师今天看到这样的一个
 Teacher Neiliang saw such a starting situation today. 
 首发情况
 对山东鲁能比较关心的最关键的
 What is the key point that Shandong Luneng is more 
 点是哪里
 concerned about? 
 最关键的
 The most crucial 
 就是费莱尼
 Is Fellaini. 
 顶到锋线唉
 Up to the front line. 
 那费莱尼
 在联赛之初曾经被李霄鹏的
 事
 至于锋线表现不错
 那后来就更多的在中后场
 那是费莱尼替替换佩莱
 我感觉从中风属性角度来讲
 可能会有一点点地打折扣
 毕竟他是这个兼职
 没有费莱尼的后防
 在防空尤其在防空
 包括这个
 中路的这个正面拦截这方面的
 有可能会出现出现一些损耗
 There may be some loss. 
 但是没有办法
 But there is no way. 
 可能对于郝伟
 Maybe for Hao Wei. 
 郝老来讲
 Hao Lao said. 
 目前这样的一个安排是最佳的
 At present
 such an arrangement is the best one for 
 攻守平衡的一个安排
 the balance of attack and defense. 
 一个中场的变化
 A change in midfield 
 一个锋线的变化
 A change in the line of attack 
 更多内容咱们来问问我们前方记者
 For more
 lets ask our reporter Sun Rui ahead. 
 孙瑞
 唉孙瑞你好
 Hello
 Sun Rui. 
 那我们首先想问一问两支球队
 Lets first ask the two teams. 
 其实应该说是中超的这种非常
 In fact
 it should be said that this is a very familiar 
 熟悉的对手
 opponent of the Chinese Super League. 
 那在今天这场比赛赛前两
 Did you observe the two teams before todays game? 
 队你有没有观察到
 比如说有没有一些场外的内容分享
 For example
 is there any off-court content to share 
 给我们
 with us? 
 刘川你好
 Hello
 Liu Chuan. 
 观众朋友大家好
 Hello
 dear viewers. 
 我现在所在位置是苏州市体育
 I am now in the Suzhou Sports Center. 
 中心
 这场比赛拿在我看来可能是双方
 In my opinion
 this match may be the most secret confrontation 
 历史交手上最没有秘密的一次对决
 in the history of the two sides. 
 这个秘密当然是打引号的
 The secret
 of course
 is in quotation marks. 
 因为这场比赛两队的这个赛前
 Because in this match
 the pre-match training factory 
 的训练厂其实是相邻的
 of the two teams is actually adjacent. 
 中间只有一道围栏隔着
 There is only one fence in the middle. 
 双方只要是通过这个围栏相对
 As long as the two sides are through the fence opposite 
 面厂去看
 the factory to see. 
 就能看清楚
 You can see it. 
 比如说人员的这个排兵布阵
 For example
 the deployment of personnel. 
 包括这这个球队的伤病以及训练
 Including the teams injuries and training content. 
 的内容
 所以说这场比赛的备战情况不仅仅
 Therefore
 the preparation for this game is not limited 
 局限在厂内谁在场外就早早开始
 to who starts early outside the factory. 
 在昨天的赛前新闻发布会上
 At yesterdays pre-match press conference 
 郝伟豪知道是直言说国安有
 Hao Weihao knows that GuoAn has two weaknesses 
 两个弱点
 就是他们的这个防守以及门将
 Its their defense and their goalkeeper. 
 而对于这个看法
 And for this view. 
 国安主帅热那笑是给予反击
 GuoAn boss Genoa smiles as he counterattacks 
 他说
 He said 
 这两个
 These two. 
 点到在第1回合交手当中并
 No problems were exposed in the first round of the 
 没有暴露出任何的问题
 match. 
 而更有意思的一点就是在昨天
 And what was even more interesting was training at 
 的时间训练
 yesterdays time. 
 最后一练声这个国安训练课
 The last sound of the GuoAn training session was a 
 是传来阵阵地笑声
 burst of laughter. 
 原来他们全队是进行一个30
 It turned out that their whole team was playing a big 
 人的一个大游戏
 game with 30 players. 
 这些笑声隔着围栏是传
 The laughter was passed to Lunengs training ground 
 到鲁能的训练场里
 through the fence. 
 鲁能还是按部就班的正常训练
 Luneng is still a normal training step by step. 
 而这一点我觉得可能是有那些要
 And at this point
 I think there may be a decompression 
 给全对国安的将士的一个减压的
 session for the players who are all playing against 
 环节
 GuoAn. 
 可能是变相在向鲁能师洋
 It may be disguised to Luneng Shiyang. 
 那这场比赛我是多次跟
 In this game
 I had a series with Hao Weichao many 
 郝伟超指导进行一个连续
 times. 
 他已经是表达过很多次
 He has expressed himself many times. 
 其实这张比赛鲁能的备战非常的
 In fact
 Luneng is well prepared for this game. 
 充分
 那据我解鲁能队这场比赛
 According to my understanding
 Luneng may have a draw 
 可能会出现的平局
 in this game. 
 加时赛以及点球大战都做
 Extra time and penalty shoot-outs were great. 
 非常
 周密的准备
 Careful preparation. 
 甚至等国安的国安的这个主罚球员
 Even waiting for the habit of GuoAns GuoAns punisher 
 的这个习惯以及鲁能主罚球员的
 and the order of Lunengs punisher 
 这个顺序
 以及手元都进行一个非常详细
 And hand yuan are prepared in a very detailed way. 
 的一个准备
 所以我觉得这些场外的情况不会
 So I dont think these off-field situations will affect 
 影响到鲁能
 Luneng. 
 的一个备战
 A preparation for war 
 他们将会在本场比赛全力以赴
 They will go all out in this game. 
 流畅
 Fluent 
 这是第1个问题的回答
 This is the answer to question 1. 
 好的
 All right 
 那我们单边时间很紧张
 Then we are very short of unilateral time. 
 再问一点
 One more question. 
 就是在最后一次训练中
 It was during the last training session. 
 莫伊塞斯状态怎样
 Hows Moises? 
 而且今天锋线上的这个变化
 And this change in the front line today. 
 孙瑞你怎看
 Sun Rui
 what do you think? 
 正好我结合这个首发名单和
 I just combined this starting list with a system that 
 我昨天看三天最后一列的一个
 I watched the last column of three days yesterday to 
 系统跟大家做一个分享
 share with you. 
 其实这张比赛有两个人员变化
 In fact
 there are two staff changes in this competition. 
 就是这个王彤还有这个佩莱
 Both Wang Tong and this Pelle are on standby. 
 都是替补待命
 其实这两名队员就解是没有任何
 In fact
 these two players did not have any injuries. 
 的伤病
 而是
 But. 
 这是好指导的一个战术上的调整
 This is a tactical adjustment with good guidance. 
 要知道现在替补席上可是坐着
 You know
 theres a double on the bench right now. 
 一个双高的组合
 佩莱和这个
 Pelle and this. 
 我佩莱和这个郭田雨
 My Pelle and this Guo Tianyu 
 而王彤其实在第一阶段比赛当中
 In fact
 Wang Tong was in the first stage of the game. 
 其实就很多时候城市过出任后腰
 In fact
 many times the city has served as the back. 
 有可能这场比赛它会出现在
 It is possible that it will be at right-back for this 
 右后卫
 game. 
 有可能出现在后腰位置
 Could be in the lower back. 
 来限制国安强大的一个中场的
 To restrict GuoAns formidable midfield to a combination 
 组组合
 那这张比赛莫伊塞斯纳情况我
 So
 this game
 Moe
 Cessna
 I can watch. 
 可以观察一下
 其实在之前他的左膝盖是有些
 In fact
 his left knee was injured before. 
 伤病的情况
 我的特点看到他在训练之前是
 My characteristic sees him before training
 is specially 
 特意找康复师做一个非常大
 looks for the rehabilitation division to do a very 
 幅度的一个牵拉的动作
 big scale pull the movement. 
 并且还不断在跟这个康复车进行
 And they are still communicating with this rehabilitation 
 交流
 vehicle. 
 随后再加入到合练的阵型当中
 Then join in the formation of the joint training. 
 所以说我觉得他可能现在不是一个
 So I think he may not be in a 100% very good state 
 100%非常好的一个状态
 now. 
 但是这我要说一点
 But I have a point to make. 
 其实在这场比赛之前
 Actually
 before this game
 
 球队一共有4名队员处理队员
 There are four players in the team to deal with a player 
 是有一个生病的情况
 who is sick. 
 像吴兴涵听到
 Like Wu Xinghan heard. 
 郑铮等等等等
 Zheng Zheng
 etc. Etc. 
 但是在他们这三名队员的赛前三天
 But none of their three players were involved in the 
 当中都是没有参与
 three days before the game. 
 到核电当中
 Into nuclear power. 
 而是在昨天最后一年当中全部出现
 But yesterday
 in the last year of all. 
 这其实是我解到他们有着非常
 This is actually my understanding that they have a 
 强烈的一个出战的愿望
 very strong desire to play. 
 但是他们三个人可能甚至两都
 But the three of them may not even reach 100% of a 
 没有达到100%的一个好的
 good situation. 
 一个状况
 所以说这场比赛在鲁能可能经历
 Therefore
 this game may experience a stock reform 
 一个股改
 in Luneng. 
 包括李霄鹏指导赛这个之前的
 Including Li Xiaopengs guidance game
 which was provided 
 一个离任提供之后的成长下
 after his departure. 
 现在都有一个非常共同的信念
 Now we all have a very common belief. 
 就是要咬牙坚持向冠军发起冲击
 Its about holding on to the title. 
 所以我相信大家用过这个杏眼一
 So I believe that everyone has used this almond eye 
 加上加可能会有一个
 and there may be one. 
 带伤上场的一个情况
 An injury situation on the field 
 这是一个非常感动的一个情况
 This is a very touching situation. 
 我相信这场比赛会是一个不错的
 Im sure this game will be a good one. 
 精彩的大战
 A good fight. 
 跑到这个车
 Run to this car. 
 好的
 All right 
 谢谢孙瑞给我们带前方的

 看完球迷们代表的一个态度
 An attitude of the fans representatives 
 相信大家很关心的就是两队
 I believe everyone is very concerned about one of the 
 的主帅赛前的一个
 two team managers before the game. 
 表态
 Take a stand 
 其实新闻发布会上两队的主帅对
 In fact
 the managers of the two teams are no strangers 
 彼此都并不陌生
 to each other at the press conference. 
 而且都被问到有可能会进行点球
 And both were asked a question about the possibility 
 大战的一个问题
 of a penalty shootout. 
 咱们来看看他们双方在赛前抵达
 Lets take a look at both of them when they arrived 
 的时候
 before the game. 
 对于我们记者关心的问题是如何
 How do we respond to our reporters concerns? 
 回应的
 这场比赛是非常关键的一站
 This game is a very important one. 
 想知道目前球队上下包括您
 Want to know the current atmosphere of the team
 including 
 整个球队的一个氛围是
 your whole team? 
 怎样的
 What kind? 
 是稍微有些紧张
 Yeah
 a little nervous. 
 还是有一个平常心应战
 Or do you have a sense of common purpose? 
 还是说可能要抱着一个这个背水一战
 Or is it possible to play this game with a determination 
 的决心去打这场比赛
 to fight against the enemy? 
 这张比赛我们全队准备的还是
 This game
 our teams preparation is still relatively 
 比较有序的
 orderly. 
 这样比赛我希望我们的球员不要
 In this game
 I hope our players dont do things with 
 用情绪办事
 emotions. 
 用脑的板希望打破这样的
 With the plate of the brain hoping to break this. 
 能知道这场比赛您一会在更衣室
 To know how you will mobilize the players in the dressing 
 里面会如何动员将士们
 room later in this game. 
 这个不用说
 This goes without saying. 
 这个肯定是赢下这场比赛的关键
 This will definitely be the key to winning this game. 
 场比赛就是能够决定是否晋级前
 The game is to decide whether to qualify or not. 
 是它的偶然因素可能会增多
 Its the chance factor that may increase. 
 那教练组和团队是否都准备好
 Are the coaching staff and the team ready to deal with 
 各种应对的这种方法
 this kind of method? 
 怎吃
 How to eat? 
 玛斯波克里

 派上上班就不

 我那没有我没说us那图标排版

 有没破
 我认为我们应该是准备好
 I think we should be ready. 
 因为我们已经把这个该做的已经
 Because we have done all that we need to do. 
 全做
 我们今天晚上会没有任何压力
 We wont have any pressure tonight. 
 全力以赴地去打好这场比赛
 Go all out to play this game. 
 当然这一场这一场足球比赛有些
 Of course
 there are some things in this football game 
 东西我们不能是100%地掌控
 that we cant control 100%. 
 但是我们还是要就是以没有任何
 But we still have to do it without any pressure. 
 的压力
 然后以最佳的这个饱满热情去
 Then take it down with the best enthusiasm. 
 把它拿下
 这场比赛
 This game. 
 OK今天
 OK Today 
 好的
 All right 
 那双方主帅的一个想法在排
 One of the ideas of the managers of both sides was 
 兵布阵上是得到一个最直接的
 directly reflected in the formation of the team. 
 体现
 所以接下来咱们邀请两位老师一
 So next
 lets invite two teachers to take a look at 
 起来看一下双方的首发
 the starters of both sides. 
 我们首先来看一下山东鲁能
 Lets first take a look at Shandong Luneng. 
 方面今天派出的一个最好的首发
 One of the best starting situations from the side today 
 情况
 和首回合相比实际上只有2点
 Compared to the first leg
 there are actually only 
 调整
 two adjustments. 
 一个是右后卫
 One is the right back. 
 上一场是王彤
 The last scene was Wang Tong. 
 今天换上老将张弛
 Bring on veteran Zhang Chi today. 
 还有就是锋线上的变化
 Then there are the changes up front. 
 那手一场
 That hand is a game. 
 先发的
 PRECURSOR 
 这个佩莱
 This Pelle. 
 今天没有首发
 No start today. 
 看看是不是费莱尼会出现在
 See if Fellaini is up front. 
 锋线上
 另外上一场比赛受伤的金敬
 In addition
 Jin Jingdao who was injured in the last 
 道今天仍然出战
 game is still playing today. 
 保密工作看来做的不错
 The secrecy seems to be working. 
 东路好像每逢重大的比赛
 East road looks like every big game. 
 主教练总是比较信任有经验
 The head coach always trusts the experience. 
 作风比较勇猛的队员
 A player with a more daring style 
 许还真是格德斯顶在最前面
 Xu Guedes is really at the top of the list. 
 费莱尼顶替佩莱的可能性我感觉
 I Dont think its too likely that Pelle will be replaced 
 不太大
 by Fellaini 
 虽然说之前看一些这个首发首发
 Although lets look at some of the starting lineup 
 的排兵
 players before. 
 排阵
 Arrange 
 费莱尼被顶到锋线
 Fellaini is headed forward. 
 但我觉得可能这个定比喻这个更
 But I think maybe this metaphor is closer to actual 
 接近于实战
 combat. 
 就是是放好几米
 Just put a few meters. 
 更多的在寻求反击的过程当中
 More in the middle of the counterattack 
 格德斯传球
 Guedes Passing 
 因为国安本身他不会反击
 Because of GuoAn
 he doesnt fight back. 
 就不会密集防守
 There will be no massing. 
 这是上一场对国安的那个进球
 That was the goal against GuoAn last time 
 天津倒地包抄
 Tianjin fell to the ground to outflank. 
 蒿俊闵
 Hao Jun Min 
 曹俊平策划这次进攻跟格德
 Cao Junping planned this combination between the attack 
 斯之间的这个配合
 and Guedes. 
 最后真正到包抄
 Finally really outflanking. 
 格德斯
 Guedes 
 它的速度肯定还是在反击当中
 Its pace is definitely still on the counter attack. 
 会是比较有优势的
 It will be more advantageous. 
 两种情况
 In two cases 
 要就是佩莱出现一定的伤情
 If there is a certain injury in Pelle. 
 要就是好给他做作战思路发生
 It is necessary to give him a fundamental change in 
 根本的变化
 his combat thinking. 
 如果要发生根本变化
 If there is to be a fundamental change
 
 实际上让格德斯顶在前面是最好
 Actually
 having Guedes up front is the best sign. 
 的体现
 因为这个比赛目前它是都
 Because this game is currently both sides on the same 
 双方在一个起跑线上
 starting line. 
 鲁能并没有落后
 Luneng is not lagging behind. 
 所以没有必要从这比赛一
 So theres no need to fight from the very beginning 
 开始阶段就大动干戈
 of this game. 
 可能还是基于双方的这个打法
 It may still be based on the play of both sides. 
 鲁能还是选球选择求稳
 Luneng still chooses the ball and chooses to be stable. 
 今天比赛的主裁判是这个赛季
 The referee of todays match is the first foreign referee 
 我们迎第1位外籍裁判
 of this season. 
 来自韩国的金希坤
 Kim Hee-kyun from South Korea 
 是国际级裁判
 Is an international referee. 
 12年就曾经来到过中超的
 He once came to the Chinese Super League in 12 years. 
 赛场
 就是这个中国足协是深刻
 It is the Chinese Football Association that is deeply 
 知道这个裁判的问题的困扰
 aware of the problems of the referee. 
 他面临着两个问题
 He faces two problems. 
 第1个问题就是外籍裁判之前
 The first problem is that it is difficult for foreign 
 很难来中国
 referees to come to China. 
 第二一个
 The second one 
 即使说是现在执法的裁判当中
 Even among the referees who are now officiating. 
 有一些可能水平或者能力或者实战
 There are some referees who may be poor in level or 
 表现不佳的这个裁判员
 ability or actual performance. 
 但是
 But 
 除此之外没有别人可用
 No one else is available. 
 所以在这种状况下
 So in this case
 
 所以中国足协是费很大
 So the Chinese Football Association has a lot of trouble. 
 的周折
 包括到西亚找
 Including West Asia. 
 包括到东南亚找
 Including Southeast Asia. 
 最后还是
 In the end. 
 韩国
 Korea 
 认为一场3000美金还是
 I think 3000 dollars a game is still a very accurate 
 可以很准确的一个数字
 figure. 
 那其实无论是争冠组还是保
 In fact
 whether it is the championship winning team 
 机组
 or the guarantee team. 
 已经各有一位韩国的主裁
 There is already a Korean referee. 
 那进驻到基地
 Then move into the base. 
 我们观察一下它们的一个表现
 Lets look at one of their manifestations. 
 说到山东鲁能有一位关键群
 Speaking of Shandong Luneng
 there is a key group. 
 其实在第1回合
 In the first round
 actually. 
 然后老师仍然表现很出色
 And the teacher still did a good job. 
 就是王大雷
 Is Wang Dalei. 
 那其实两队的主帅都在赛前被
 In fact
 both managers were asked before the game. 
 问到
 有可能进入到比如说加时或者点球
 It could go to
 say
 extra time or penalties. 
 大战
 王磊
 Wang Lei 
 他在这方面本身是有它的一个优势
 He has an advantage in this respect. 
 大雷你比较熟悉
 Big Ray
 youre familiar with. 
 谁比较熟时我还可以
 Who is more mature when I can. 
 我觉得就上场比赛之后跟
 I think I spoke to him after the game. 
 他有过沟通
 他说长时间没打比赛
 He said he hadnt played for a long time. 
 然后能恢复这样一个状态
 Then we can restore such a state. 
 它自己是比较满意
 It is more satisfied by itself. 
 自己比较满意
 I am more satisfied. 
 尤其是费尔南多那个定位球两
 Especially Fernandos set-piece double set-piece test. 
 次定位球的考验
 还有就是定位球之后的那个
 Then theres the one after the set-piece. 
 国安队的补射完成得非常好
 Guoans follow-up shot was very good. 
 但是我我我实在举觉得这比赛不会
 But I-I-I really dont think its going to be a penalty. 
 打点球
 我觉得不会拿点球
 I dont think it will be a penalty. 
 无论后会打点球
 Whether its a penalty or not. 
 我们要观察一下
 We need to observe. 
 看走这句话
 Look at this sentence. 
 反正任何比分的平局
 Any score draw anyway. 
 那就是友加
 Thats Yuga. 
 时
 Time 
 没有加时
 No overtime. 
 我就盼着有驾驶
 Im looking forward to driving. 
 你可11:30飞机对我加时
 You can have extra time on the 11:30 plane. 
 可以
 但是别打点球
 But dont take the penalty. 
 因为打点球有可能又得30分钟
 Another 30 minutes on the penalty kick. 
 出去
 董老师对时间上的一个估计和
 Teacher Dongs estimate and expectation of time. 
 期待
 无论最后会不会到点球
 Penalty or no penalty in the end 
 其实王大雷在门前镇守龙门本身
 In fact
 Wang Dalei guards the gate itself in front 
 of the gate. 
 其实对国安的锋线来说
 In fact
 for GuoAns forward line
 
 我觉得就是一个威慑
 I think its a deterrent. 
 咱们来看看北京国安今天那个
 Lets take a look at Beijing GuoAns starting situation 
 首发情况是有一点的变化
 today
 which is a little bit different. 
 上一场比赛在下半场连扳两
 Twice in the second half of the last game 
 球
 扳平比分
 To tie the score 
 其实给热内效益强烈的信心
 In fact
 it gives strong confidence in thermal efficiency. 
 而且在上一场比赛最后时刻
 And at the end of the last game. 
 张稀哲和奥古斯托都是替补打
 Zhang Xizhe and Augusto were both substitutes for about 
 10分钟左右
 10 minutes. 
 今天奥古斯托首发出场
 Augusto starts today. 
 顶替费尔南多还是442的
 Fernando or the 4-4-2? 
 阵型
 东路
 Dong Lu 
 这两个人虽然都是外援
 These two are both foreign players. 
 但两个人的进攻和防守的属性大
 But the attacking and defensive attributes of the two 
 大不同
 men are vastly different. 
 应该说奥古斯托对国安对非常重要
 It should be said that Augusto is very important to 
 GuoAn. 
 因为它不仅是一个奥古斯托
 Because its not just an Augusto thing. 
 的事
 他可能会一上场之后会激发比
 Hell probably inspire another 20% of Viera once hes 
 埃拉另外20%的
 on the pitch. 
 这个潜在的能量
 This latent energy. 
 再有就是鲁能他的防守其实
 Another is that Lunengs defense is actually in the 
 在禁区前沿地带
 front of the penalty area. 
 是有是是有问题的
 Yes
 yes
 there is a problem. 
 那恰恰奥古斯托比埃拉非常
 So
 Augusto Viera is very willing to do something near 
 愿意在禁区弧顶附近哪搞事情
 the top of the box. 
 所以这样的一个攻击
 So such an attack. 
 方式是不是会给鲁能的这个
 Will the way bring a threat to Lunengs defensive zone 
 中卫身前的防守地带带去威胁
 in front of the center back? 
 还有一点
 One more thing. 
 国安对今天的这个中前场6
 Of the six men in the centre and frontcourt today
 
 个人当中
 GuoAn 
 其实可能很难以位置来具体限定
 In fact
 it may be difficult to specify the location. 
 我估计可能是类似一个4222的
 I think it might be a formation like 4222. 
 这一个阵型
 上场比赛张玉宁就频频地
 Zhang Yuning frequently appeared on the wing in the 
 会出现在边路I
 last match. 
 所以相对而言
 So
 relatively speaking
 
 国安队的进攻方式和方法
 The attacking style and method of Guoan 
 要多一些
 A little more. 
 当然
 Of course 
 对于国安对的边路进攻
 For GuoAns attacks on the flanks 
 尤其两个边后卫的助攻
 In particular
 the assists of the two full-backs 
 现在所有的对手都非常的重视
 Now all the opponents attach great importance to it. 
 是
 所以你会发现王刚和李磊的
 So you will find that the role of Wang Gang and Li 
 作用其实在逐渐的缩小
 Lei is actually gradually shrinking. 
 但是她俩仍然保留着在边路
 But they still retain the function of attacking on 
 突击的这样一个功能
 the side road. 
 所以威慑力有一定的威慑力
 So deterrence has a certain deterrent power. 
 那它可能会让对方的防守会
 Then it may make the opponents defense a little more 
 更更分散一些
 scattered. 
 那会不会给奥古斯托比埃拉
 Will that give Augusto Viera Bakambu? 
 巴坎布
 包括张玉宁在中路的攻击会创造
 Including Zhang Yunings attack in the middle will 
 一定的空间
 create some space. 
 能不能看到两位在边路起飞的
 Can you see the two taking off on the wings? 
 样子
 大家很关心
 Everyone is very concerned. 
 那同时这场比赛我们说到
 And at the same time
 this game
 were talking about 
 北京国安在这场的赛前好为
 Beijing GuoAns guidance ahead of this game 
 指导
 在新闻发布会直言不讳地指出
 Speaking bluntly at a press conference
 GuoAn said 
 说国安是一个强大的对手
 he was a formidable opponent 
 但他们有自己的弱点
 But they have their weaknesses. 
 还会指导说国安的弱点是在于门将
 It will also be said that GuoAns weakness is a problem 
 和后防线的一个问题
 with the goalkeeper and the defence 
 那今天奥古的这样的一个付出
 Will Ogus effort today be at both ends? 
 会不会在攻防两端
 其实对球队都是一个保障
 In fact
 it is a guarantee for the team. 
 门将的问主要问题
 The main question from the goalkeeper 
 我认为是脚下
 I think its the foot. 
 就他的脚下非常糙
 His feet are very rough. 
 就是当每一次后卫回传给
 Is when every time a defender passes back to 
 国安们现在这个门将的时候
 When the GuoAn are in goal now 
 我感觉就是所有的
 I feel like its all. 
 的他的教练组或者替补队员场上
 His coaching staff or the substitutes are nervous on 
 队员都会很紧张
 the pitch. 
 我想这个会不会成为好炜
 I wonder if this will be a good Wei? 
 在关键时刻去B
 Go to B at the critical moment 
 他不见得是时刻都在防守反击
 Hes not always on the counter. 
 他一旦有机会
 When he gets the chance. 
 他就前场逼迫抢门将
 Hes going up front to force the goalkeeper. 
 有可能会是
 It could be. 
 这个或者是强门将出的质量不
 This or a poor ball from a strong goalkeeper. 
 高的球
 可能会是鲁能的一个一个一个前
 It may be Lunengs attack equation in the frontcourt 
 场攻击的方程
 one by one. 
 场地
 Site 
 二个点球就是如此
 That was the case with the two penalties. 
 对
 Yes 
 另外他还说什
 And what else did he say? 
 第2点说后防线后甚至王刚的
 The second point is that behind the defensive line 
 身后
 and even behind Wang Gang. 
 对类似王刚的身后
 Yes
 similar to Wang Gangs back. 
 包括就是他两个中卫
 That includes him and the two central defenders. 
 有的时候处理球
 Sometimes dealing with the ball. 
 尤其像这个韩国这个金珉载
 Especially like this South Korean
 this Kim Min-jae. 
 他有能力
 He has the ability. 
 但他有时候太过自信
 But sometimes hes too confident. 
 他有时候太自信的这种处理
 He is sometimes too confident in this kind of handling. 
 处理好
 Deal with it. 
 非常漂亮
 Its beautiful. 
 相当潇洒
 Pretty cool. 
 处理不好
 Not Handled 
 很有可能会给对手一定的
 Chances are it will give the opposition a chance. 
 机会
 那两支球队对于彼此的一个
 An understanding between the two teams 
 解
 再加上其实这一场比赛至关重要
 Plus
 this game is actually very important. 
 然而球队的命运会发生这样的
 However
 the teams fate will take place such a watershed 
 一个分水岭的变化
 change. 
 那今天这场比赛的赛前
 Before todays game. 
 我们是有互动话题
 We have an interactive topic. 
 要和大家展示和互动一下
 I want to show and interact with you. 
 那来邀请您来讨论6天之内第
 Then you are invited to discuss the second bus station 
 2场经路大站
 in 6 days. 
 那位两位老对手本赛季最终排名
 The two old rivals ended the season in a watershed 
 成为一道分水岭
 position. 
 那胜者将跻身前4
 The winner will be in the top four. 
 拜者只能参与5~8名的一个排位赛
 Worshippers can only participate in a qualifying match 
 of 5 to 8. 
 那您最期待哪位球员或者是谁
 Which player or who are you looking forward to most? 
 的临场发挥
 这个范围很大
 This range is very large. 
 我们看到第1个球迷就说最期待
 We saw the first fan said that he expected the referee 
 裁判的一个正常发挥
 to play normally. 
 我们呈现一场精彩而连贯的比赛
 We presented a good and consistent game. 
 这是韩国籍主裁
 This is the Korean referee. 
 那这个赛季第1场我们
 Lets take a look at the first game of this season. 
 是观察一下
 那还有球迷说期待看到更多国安
 There are also fans who say they are looking forward 
 球迷到现场
 to seeing more GuoAn fans at the scene. 
 今天数量不少
 There are a lot of them today. 
 还有球迷提到说绝境蒿俊闵
 There are also fans who mention that Hao Junmin is 
 那是说到三哥在关键时刻
 Its about the third brother in the crucial moment. 
 作用
 但我相信鲁能球迷不想到绝境
 But I believe Luneng fans dont want to be desperate. 
 王大雷目测点球大战很有可能出现
 Wang Dalei looks at the possibility of a penalty shootout 
 期待
 大雷的发挥还有期待
 Big thunders play also has the anticipation. 
 好
 OK 
 伟知道第2场比赛的一个临场发挥的
 Wei knows a stopgap judgment for Game 2. 
 判断
 反正我知道董老师肯定不期待点球
 Anyway
 I know that Mr. Dong is definitely not expecting 
 大战
 a penalty shootout. 
 还有国安球迷说期待比埃拉
 And GuoAn fans say to expect Viera to be quick 
 的表现小快灵那
 有很多球迷爱称比埃拉是笔仙
 There are many fans who love to call Viera a pen fairy. 
 那有球迷说
 And the fans say. 
 想看看郭田雨在场上能不能有
 Want to see if Guo Tianyu can have some space and opportunities 
 一定的空间和机会
 on the field? 
 但像这样的一场比赛
 But a game like this 
 看看年轻球员有没有机会上场
 See if the young players have a chance to play. 
 另外提到吴兴涵受伤的过程
 In addition
 Wu Xinghan was injured. 
 鲁能的中前场缺乏速度的情况下
 Lunengs lack of speed in the middle and frontcourt 
 那看看今天格德斯能不能做一个
 Well
 lets see if Guedes can make a bomb today. 
 爆点
 唉一上很多的球迷对本场比赛都
 Well
 a lot of fans in the world have a lot of expectations 
 有很多的期待和盼望
 and hopes for this game. 
 而一切的比赛都会在今天的场

 比赛
 就要开始
 Its about to start. 
 两支队伍应该说都拥有着非常
 It should be said that both teams have a very. 
 深厚的底蕴
 Profound inside information 
 过往有多次的
 Many times in the past 
 巅峰的对决
 A showdown at the top. 
 今天是他们联赛的第54次教授
 Today is the 54th professor of their league. 
 国安主帅热内西奥一直以来
 GuoAn boss Genesio has never quite conquered 
 没有完全的征服
 北京媒体或者北京球迷的心
 The hearts of Beijing media or Beijing fans 
 而山东鲁能这边前任
 Shandong Lunengs predecessor. 
 主教练李霄鹏是
 Head coach Li Xiaopeng is 
 评价不宜
 Unsuitable for evaluation 
 所以不得不说在这样的俱乐部担任
 So it has to be said that at a club like this 
 主教练的
 传说可能工资不少
 Legend has it that salaries can be high. 
 但是压力不小
 But the pressure is not small. 
 从热内西奥率队跟山东鲁能交手
 Judging from the situation when Genesio led the team 
 的情况来看
 to play against Shandong Luneng. 
 倒还可以
 Its all right. 
 上赛季最后一轮
 The final round of last season 
 他率领国安队是3:2战胜
 He led Guoan to a 3-2 win over Shandong Luneng. 
 山东鲁能
 而这个赛季就在6天前
 And this season
 just six days ago
 
 厄0:2落后的情况下
 At 2-0 down to the score 
 国安队是2:2
 Guoan is 2-2. 
 战平山东鲁能
 Zhan Ping Shan Dong Lu Neng 
 浩俊敏微笑着跟助理裁判在
 Hao Junmin smiles and chats with the assistant referee. 
 聊天
 公安这边看上去在赛前的
 It seems that before the game
 
 时候
 替补队员表情非常轻松
 The substitutes expression is very relaxed. 
 对
 Yes 
 今天场上队长的袖标交给奥
 The captains armband goes to Augusto today 
 古斯托
 好
 OK 
 马上是做国歌的仪式
 Its time for the national anthem. 
 哦
 Oh 
 出场的时候
 On the field. 
 山东鲁能的4个外援还是齐刷刷
 Shandong Lunengs 4 foreign players are still in the 
 的走在后边
 back. 
 奏国歌仪式的时候
 When the national anthem was played. 
 我们看到队长蒿俊闵和王大雷
 We saw captains Hao Junmin and Wang Dalei to be able 
 为能够看见国旗
 to see the flag. 
 还稍稍偏离队伍
 Slightly off the team. 
 作为球员
 As a player 
 2004年就是中超元年
 2004 is the first year of the Chinese Super League. 
 郝伟在国安对曾经有过一个赛季
 Hao Wei had one season of service in GuoAn 
 的效力
 在联赛中出场13次
 13 appearances in the league 
 好
 OK 
 山东鲁能的先发阵容
 Shandong Lunengs starting lineup 
 只有格德斯身上没牌
 Only the Guedes has no license. 
 我们看到还有王大雷
 We saw Wang Dalei. 
 后防线上只有一个变化
 Just one change at the back. 
 就是由张弛取代王彤出现在
 It was Zhang Chi who replaced Wang Tong at right-back. 
 右后卫的位置上
 今天比赛的主裁判是金希坤
 The referee for todays match is Kim Hee-Koon. 
 两个助理裁判王德鑫和曹毅
 Two assistant referees Wang Dexin and Cao Yi 
 视频助理裁判是马宁
 The VAR is Ma Ning. 
 另外我看到在这个
 Besides
 I saw in this. 
 赛区
 Competition Area 
 官方首发名单上还有一个新的
 There is also a new role in the official starting line-up. 
 角色
 就是替补裁判石祯禄
 Is substitute referee Shi Zhenlu. 
 那在过往的比赛当中
 That in past competitions. 
 如果主裁判出现意外情况的
 If the referee has an accident. 
 话
 往往是由第四官员入T完成比赛
 It is often the fourth official who completes the enforcement 
 的执法工作
 work of the competition. 
 但今天可能足协是格外的重视
 But today
 the Football Association may pay extra attention 
 to it. 
 不仅本赛季第1次邀请境外裁判
 Not only the first time this season invited overseas 
 执法
 referees to enforce the law 
 同时还安排一个替补裁判
 A substitute referee is also arranged. 
 老资格裁判吃着路
 Veteran referee eats the road. 
 这是双方替补席上的情况
 That is the situation on both benches. 
 相对来讲
 Relatively speaking 
 国安队方面
 Guoan team 
 可调兵遣将使用的人员是
 The number of personnel that can be deployed is large. 
 很多的
 其实两回合比赛赛前热内校都
 In fact
 Geno expressed strong confidence before the 
 表达出比较强的自信
 two legs. 
 那
 That 
 上一回合上半场的0:2落后
 2-0 down at half-time in the last leg 
 可能一度让他感到非常的
 It might have been very confusing for him. 
 困惑
 好
 OK 
 在下半场比赛国安队是连扳两
 In the second half
 Guoan scored two goals in a row. 
 球
 将比分扳成2:2
 Make the score 2-2. 
 奥古斯托的上场对国安队应该说
 Augustos appearance should bring great improvement 
 中前场的发挥会带来很大的提升
 to Guoans performance in the middle and front court. 
 同时比埃拉跟奥古斯托之前的
 At the same time
 the connection between Vieira and 
 连线
 Augusto 
 应该说是国安队进攻非常锐利
 It should be said that Guoan is a very sharp weapon 
 的武器
 in attack. 
 当然在这个赛季奥古斯托跟
 Of course
 this season Augusto and Birra have played 
 比尔拉相互之间的这种串联配合
 well in tandem. 
 好
 比较于以往两个赛季要少一些
 Less than in the last two seasons. 
 是
 Yes 
 当于大宝淡出首发阵容之后
 After Yu Dabao faded out of the starting line-up 
 于洋顶上
 Yu Yang Ding Shang 
 而且在比赛当中担任过场上
 And he captained the team during the match. 
 队长
 当快乐足球不在的时候
 When the happy football is not there 
 巴坎布奉献两个非常扎实的
 Two very solid goals from Bakambu 
 进球
 目前让自己在射手榜上是排在
 At present
 he is ranked No.1 in the shooting list. 
 第1位
 好
 OK 
 主裁判亲戚关系声场上

 左脚的传中头球攻门

 其实这是一个好机会

 对

 国安经常是慢热
 GuoAn is often slow. 
 这球直接打透

 李磊的身后事

 刘洋补过去

 左脚的传球这个球员说难度不
 The left-footed pass is not too difficult for this 
 大
 player. 
 他可能对球速判断有一些问题
 He may have some problems with the speed of the ball. 
 这个球难度可真的不大
 This ball is really not difficult. 
 高位逼抢
 High Position Closure 
 就是要利用对方门将这个脚下
 It is to take advantage of the weakness of the opposing 
 功夫不是很娴熟这一个弱点
 goalkeeper that he is not very skilled. 
 奥古斯托虽然上一场比赛替补
 Augusto played 10 minutes as a substitute in the last 
 打10分钟
 game. 
 但整个竞技状态如何
 But what about the overall state of play? 
 今天还要再看一看
 Ill take another look at it today. 
 费莱尼又饶上一脚哼
 Fellaini got another kick in the mouth.

 我不知道你注意到没有
 I dont know if youve noticed. 
 在第二阶段比赛开始的时候
 At the beginning of the second stage of the game. 
 有多场比赛
 There are many games. 
 裁判的执法实际上悄然发生
 There are actually some changes in the referees officiating. 
 一些变化
 就是一般的身体对抗
 Its a general physical confrontation. 
 在足球范围之内的裁判不再盲目
 Referees in football no longer blow their whistles 
 吹哨
 blindly 
 比赛一时打得要比第一阶段
 It was a little more physical than the first period. 
 身体对抗要更激烈一些
 这尤其以上海滩德比
 This is especially true above the Beach Derby. 
 上海申花和上海上港那场较量
 The match between Shanghai Shenhua and Shanghai SIPG 
 喂非常的
 Hey
 very. 
 典型
 Typical 
 今天下午
 This afternoon. 
 大连人和石家庄永昌的比赛对抗
 The match between Dalian and Shijiazhuang Yongchang 
 非常的激烈
 was very fierce. 
 我们经常可以看到裁判的手势
 We can often see the referees gestures. 
 告诉躺在场地上的球员起来起来
 Tell the players lying on the field to get up. 
 起来
 没有吹犯规
 No foul called. 
 今天李可的位置相对有点香
 Today
 Li Kes position is relatively fragrant. 
 开局阶段靠前
 Up front in the opening stages. 
 这个可能是利用它压在前场
 This may be using it to press forward. 
 可能就地反响能力比较强
 Perhaps the ability to respond on the spot is stronger. 
 短球
 Short Ball 
 又是段刘愚
 Another Duan Liu Yu. 
 对今天段刘愚显示出状态是不错
 For today
 Duan Liu Yu shows that he is in good condition. 
 上一场比赛它因为伤情
 It was replaced by Huang Cong due to injury in the 
 被黄聪换下
 last game. 
 黄聪的发挥好像没有起到很好
 Huang Congs play did not seem to have a good tactical 
 的战术作用
 effect. 
 必须的球迷朋友
 A must have fan friend. 
 本场比赛进球之后
 After the goal of the game 
 苏宁易购将为大家送上现金红包
 Suning Easy-to-buy will send you a cash red envelope. 
 雨抢好货就上苏宁易购
 Rain grabs good goods on Suning Easy-to-buy. 
 李磊左路
 Li Lei left 
 上一场比赛
 The last game. 
 李磊有一个非常漂亮的传中
 Li Lei has a very nice cross. 
 周公巴坎布扳平比分
 Bakambu Zhou Gong equalizes 
 奥古斯托对今天奥古斯托一开场
 Augusto opens for Augusto today 
 更多的位置是在后腰
 More of the position is at the back. 
 热点校是想利用他的串联技术
 Hotspot is trying to use his tandem technology. 
 是中国做一个横向的转移
 It is China that makes a horizontal transfer. 
 交给右边后卫王刚
 Give it to right back Wang Gang 
 张玉宁出击
 Zhang Yuning strikes 
 张玉宁上一场比赛表现的还是
 Zhang Yuning did well in the last game. 
 不错的
 就他很活跃拿球
 Hes active on the ball. 
 是比较稳
 Its more stable. 
 但受限于这个U23的政策
 But subject to this U23 policy. 
 在郭全博不能出场
 Guo Quanbo cant play. 
 侯永永又做手术
 Hou Yongyong has an operation again. 
 所以现在国安队的123可用球员
 Therefore
 there are not many 123 available players 
 是不多
 in Guoan now. 
 达尔大脚解围出边线
 Dahl clears off the line. 
 从目前来看
 For the time being. 
 几分钟大致能看出来双方的
 A couple of minutes gives a rough indication of the 
 意图
 intent of both sides. 
 国安这边
 This side of GuoAn 
 力求是通过
 Strive to adopt 
 边路来
 By the way. 
 通过奥古斯托在中场的组织
 Through Augustos organisation in midfield 
 然后把李可的位置前提
 Then put the premise of Li Kes position. 
 给予对手在中后场控球
 A pressure given to an opponent to keep the ball in 
 的一个压迫
 the centre of the field 
 然后还是想利用两个边争取能够
 Then I still want to use two sides to strive for the 
 下底
 bottom. 
 山东鲁能泰山这边阵型
 Shandong Luneng Taishans formation is 4141 when they 
 进攻的时候是4141
 attack. 
 防守的时候洛城4411
 LA 4411 when defending 
 那莫塞斯可能受限于他的
 So Moses may be limited by his physical condition. 
 身体状况
 防守的时候
 When defending. 
 他更多地出现在前腰的位置
 He is more in the front of the waist position. 
 格德斯是顶在最前面
 The Guedes is at the top 
 而且今天山东鲁能好像有意回收
 And today
 Shandong Luneng seems to be intentionally 
 要比较多一些
 recycling more. 
 他是你拿门球的时候
 Hes the one you get the ball for. 
 我就会高位逼抢你
 I will force you to a high position 
 但是B不住我就退回来
 But Ill return it if B doesnt live. 
 退的比较深
 RETROGRADE 
 在右路张弛持球
 Hold the ball wide on the right 
 看一下位置
 Look at the location. 
 漂亮
 Pretty 
 精彩的射门来自莫伊塞斯
 Brilliant shot from Moises 
 这就是官哪它菱形中场它的边
 This is Guanna diamond midfield and its winger. 
 前卫
 没法对为对方的后卫
 Cant deal with the defender. 
 所以你看刚才张弛持球待
 So you see Zhang Chi was holding the ball just now. 
 可能得有26米37
 It could be 26.37 meters. 
 没有人没有人上去
 No one. No one. 
 你看在这个位置上这轻松的
 You see
 in this position
 its easy. 
 这个45度传中
 This 45 degrees cross. 
 所以这就是国安整个阵型的一个
 So thats one of the strengths and weaknesses of GuoAns 
 优点缺陷
 whole formation 
 它优点它是进攻的时候
 Its advantage is that it is time to attack. 
 可能中路集中兵力打歼灭战
 Possibility of concentrating forces in the middle for 
 但它缺点就是对方一旦边后卫有
 But the downside is that once the full back has the 
 足够的能力
 quality
 
 那持球的时候往往是2打
 When he holds the ball
 it is often 2 to 1 against 
 1打李磊
 Li Lei. 
 咱们来看一下
 Lets take a look. 
 在6分钟的时候
 In six minutes. 
 莫言赛斯有这好位置的一个
 After Mo Yansais had a chance to shoot from a good 
 射门机会之后
 position 
 山东鲁能会不会加大边后卫插
 Will Shandong Luneng increase the penetration of full-backs? 
 上的幅度
 右侧的角球机会
 Corner from the right 
 向外旋转
 Rotate outwards 
 巴坎布第1点顶出来
 The first point of the Bakambu 
 看部往往成防角球的时候
 The referee often gets the first point when he is defending 
 经常能抢到第1点
 a corner kick. 
 漂流
 Drift 
 连续角球
 A succession of corners 
 我按着防守现在有点乱
 Im in a bit of a mess now. 
 不知道在赛前是不是国安对
 I Dont know if GuoAn is full of confidence before 
 信心满满
 the game. 
 但开场这六七分钟山东鲁能打的
 But in the opening six or seven minutes
 Shandong Luneng 
 是稳准狠
 played steadily and accurately. 
 奥古斯托这球唉想造越位
 Augusto is trying to be offside. 
 4号李磊夺最后
 No.4 Li Lei won the last prize. 
 所以对于国安来讲
 So for GuoAn
 
 现在把李可赶紧调回来
 Now get Li Ke back here. 
 跟这个池忠国打成双后腰是比较
 It is wise to play with this Chi Zhongguo. 
 明智
 对
 Yes 
 如果还把立刻往前扔50多
 If you throw forward 50 more immediately
 
 托
 To 
 其实防守到位率不高
 In fact
 the defense rate is not high. 
 那就就边路很难阻挡
 Its hard to stop on the wing. 
 鲁能越提信心可能越强
 The more Luneng mentions
 the stronger the confidence 
 是这样
 Yes
 it is. 
 之前两支球队在联赛中交手53
 The two teams have met 53 times in the league before. 
 次
 国安队赢14次
 Guoan won 14 times 
 鲁能赢20次
 Luneng won 20 times. 
 另外还有多达19场的平局
 There have also been 19 draws. 
 这个平均场次是非常多
 The average number of games is very many. 
 在中超时代是33场
 33 in the CSL era 
 国安队赢9场输13场
 Guoan wins 9
 loses 13 
 有10 11场是平局
 There were 1
011 draws. 
 看鲁能的U
 Look at Lunengs U 
 边路
 Sideways 
 两个人在那蓄势待发
 Two men are there
 ready to go. 
 对
 Yes 
 如果有大范围的转移
 If theres a mass transfer
 
 漂亮
 Pretty 
 俄罗斯
 Russia 
 右脚打门打的是很突然
 The right foot hit the door is very sudden. 
 但稍微偏一些
 But a little bit. 
 目前国安的防守问题是这样的
 GuoAns defensive problems are like this at the moment 
 第一它的两个前锋
 First
 its two strikers. 
 站位太平
 Taiping Station 
 他没有一个纵身11
 He didnt have a jump. 
 第二一个就是他的两个边前卫
 The second one is his two wingers. 
 几乎没有他没有边前卫
 Hardly. He doesnt have a wingman. 
 所以一方面就是山东鲁能
 So on the one hand
 Shandong Luneng is in the midfield. 
 在中场的
 传控
 Transmission Control 
 因为你的两个前锋不回来防守
 Because your two strikers dont come back to defend. 
 他会很容易再有一个
 Hell easily have another one. 
 就是如果你的边前卫不到位
 That is
 if your wingers arent there
 
 正好50都不到位
 Exactly 50 are not in place. 
 那张弛好
 That one is good. 
 和郑铮好
 He Zheng Zheng Hao 
 这边的郑铮那边的张弛
 Zheng Zheng here and Zhang Chi there 
 可能会有更多的机会
 There could be more chances. 
 前面几分钟进攻打得不错
 Good attacking play in the first few minutes. 
 所以山东鲁能马上形成一个
 So Shandong Luneng immediately formed a high position 
 高位的逼抢
 of the closing down. 
 国安对从门将到后卫在出球的
 GuoAn wants to play wide from goalkeeper to defender 
 时候想打到边路
 when the ball is out 
 结果是皮球出边线
 It ends up out on the touchline. 
 但这个球
 But the ball. 
 可能裁判判给国安队
 Maybe the referee awarded Guoan. 
 是一个后场的界外球
 Its a throw from the back. 
 听清道和上一场一样还是出现在
 Listen
 the same as last game
 still on the left. 
 左路
 而在李霄鹏手下
 And under Li Xiaopeng. 
 它经常是在右路出现
 It often appears on the right. 
 对
 Yes 
 你看鲁能它这个防守就莫
 You see
 Luneng
 this defense has a certain depth with 
 赛斯跟这个格德斯还有一定
 this Guedes. 
 的纵深
 莫伊塞斯相当于是个前
 Moises is a front man. 
 腰
 又是张驰张驰
 Its Zhang Chi. Zhang Chi. 
 按说是奥古斯托的对位对
 Its supposed to be Augustos counterpoint. 
 你看右路人
 Look at the passerby on the right. 
 这教练脚后跟
 The coach has a heel. 
 这教练是看不出来
 The coach cant see that. 
 这个太容易
 This is too easy 
 太容易把球传到对方的禁区
 Too easy to get the ball into the opposition box. 
 这个山东鲁能可能会越踢信心
 Shandong Luneng may play with more confidence. 
 越强
 现在是今天到段刘愚分居左右
 Now it is today that Duan Liu Yu is separated. 
 这10分钟显然鲁能表现
 These 10 minutes were clearly better for Luneng. 
 更好
 因为它的整个的
 Because its whole. 
 战术体系构建的更
 Construction of Tactical System 
 更充实一些
 A little more substantial. 
 无论是进攻还是防守
 Whether attacking or defending 
 当然国安因为他有这个瞬间
 Of course
 GuoAn
 because he has this moment
 this 
 这个改变比赛能力的这个腿队员
 leg player who can change the game. 
 无论是奥古斯托比埃拉的突破
 No matter how far Augusto Viera breaks 50. 
 50多远射
 还是这个
 Or this one? 
 巴坎布的突然间插身后
 The sudden thrust of the Bakambu behind 
 所以目前来讲还是看双方谁
 So at present
 it depends on who is on both sides. 
 能够抓住机会
 Capable of seizing an opportunity 
 我能从体系角度来讲
 I can speak from a system perspective. 
 这场比赛现在发挥的还是不错
 This game is still playing well. 
 是那点对点的防守
 Its that point-to-point defense. 
 山东鲁能做的是非常好的
 What Shandong Luneng did was very good. 
 对
 Yes 
 百分百男士定制清扬邀您观看中超
 100% Mens Custom Qingyang invites you to watch the 
 赛事冠军表现无懈可击
 Chinese Super League champions impeccable performance. 
 别
 Dont. 
 尝试外围的远射
 Try a long shot from the outside. 
 11分钟国安队友
 11: GuoAns team-mate 
 第1次射门来自别
 The first shot came from the other. 
 两支球队近几年的交手当中
 The two teams have met in recent years. 
 奥古斯托表现还是非常出色的
 Augusto is still very good. 
 总共有过两个进球和4个主攻
 There have been two goals and four strikes. 
 佩莱有过三个进球和两个助攻
 Pelle has three goals and two assists 
 而格德斯去年一年大国对
 And Guedes scored four goals in three games last year 
 三场比赛就进4个球
 alone 
 右后卫是用张弛
 The right back is using Zhang Chi. 
 上一场用的王彤
 Wang Tong used in the last scene. 
 王统表现真的很一般
 Wang Tongs performance is really ordinary. 
 包括那个
 Including that. 
 争议的点球是来自于他的解围
 The controversial penalty came from his clearance. 
 打在刘军帅的腿上
 Hit Liu Junshuai in the leg. 
 这时候进入阵地战
 At this time
 we entered the position war. 
 看反击回敲
 Look at the back pass. 
 王大雷的脚法非常出色
 Wang Daleis foot is very good. 
 是准确的找到段刘愚
 It was accurate to find Duan Liu Yu. 
 但是我感觉15分钟以后
 But I feel like 15 minutes later 
 可能整个的局势还会国安能更多
 Maybe the whole situation will be more under control 
 的控制下来
 in GuoAn. 
 但鲁能不动则已
 But Luneng did not move. 
 一动好像
 Move as if 
 就能威胁到国安对的腹地
 It could threaten GuoAns heartland. 
 是的
 Yes 
 这应该会让国安队有所忌惮
 This should make Guoan afraid. 
 对
 Yes 
 但是现在关键的就是吴兴涵的
 But now the key is Wu Xinghans missing love. 
 缺阵的爱
 其实让他在锋线上的速度会
 In fact
 let him in the front of the speed will be 
 降是这样

 上一场比赛在下半场曾经让

 打过一段时间
 For a while. 
 唉
 Oh. 
 卡达尔在跟自己的后卫线的交流
 Kadar in communication with his own back line 
 因为国安本来就有有这个慢
 Because GuoAn has this problem of slow heat. 
 热的毛病
 所以可能一点点的激发出来

 鲁能接下来10分钟可能要面对
 Luneng may face some defensive pressure in the next

 he was not particularly 
 讲不是特别好的
 good in the strict sense. 
 反击机会
 Chances on the counter 
 因为在边路他不是说是二点
 Because on the wing he didnt say two in the middle. 
 求在中路
 那肯定是万马狂奔的
 That must be a million horses running. 
 国安对这段时间你看他节奏打
 GuoAn is not playing at a good pace these days. 
 得不快
 追求比较平稳的传递

 原来他是两个后腰

 但是有时候进攻的时候
 But sometimes when you attack
 
 费莱尼一个人在后边

 砸在边线上又往回转
 It hits the sideline and turns around. 
 就国安队中场的历这4个人
 As far as the history of Guoans midfield is concerned
 
 可能相对来讲走位比较漂
 these four players may be relatively drifting. 
 这个对进攻肯定有利的
 This is definitely good for the offense. 
 但是防守因为你位置有的时候
 But defending because your position is sometimes not 
 不是很固定
 very fixed. 
 你甚至有两个人会跑到一个位置
 You even have two people running to the same spot. 
 上
 那

 有可能

 这个漏的空间会被利用

 这巴坎布没什作用
 This Bakambu is useless. 
 这表明鲁能的防守
 This shows Lunengs defense. 
 还是做的不错的
 Its still doing well. 
 前场刚才是就地围抢4个人
 Four men on the spot in the frontcourt. 
 在封堵着国安队的这个后场的
 The so-called pass in the backcourt that blocked Guoan. 
 所谓的传控
 还是左路出问题
 Is there a problem on the left? 
 会感觉管
 Sensory Tube 
 山东鲁能队的这个针对性要
 Shandong Lunengs pertinence should be stronger. 
 更强势的
 所以整个的打法应该说更
 So the whole play should be said to be more organized 
 有组织或者是更有设计感

 Kadar and Zheng Zheng? 
 可能郑铮的对王刚不是郑铮

 的这个转身速度更快一些

 放在中尉上尉
 Put it in Lieutenant. 
 卡波

 我说这个劲唉这个球又快乐

 所以巴坎布说天生时说
 So Bakambu said

 金敬道

 现场球迷好像又骂起来
 The fans at the scene seemed to curse again. 
 奥古斯托把球放在错误的位置
 Augusto puts the ball in the wrong place. 
 今才应该会把他叫回来
 Im supposed to call him back today. 
 其实刚才这个国安对这个进球
 In fact
 this GuoAn is relatively simple for this goal. 
 是比较简单
 有奥古斯托传给比埃拉
 Theres Augusto to Viera. 
 不是传给巴坎布
 Not to Bakambu. 
 巴坎布瞬间对的
 The Bakambu is instantaneous. 
 就是刘军帅
 It is Liu Junshuai. 
 你想想这俩人
 Think about these two. 
 你说相当于腰围能一样

 Just move your chest forward. 
 对手不敢动

 今天场上巴西人不少

 各打半场好球
 Each good half of the game 
 因为两个球队不仅本土球员出色
 Because its not just the local players that are good. 
 而且有高水平的外援
 And there are high level foreign players. 
 有的时候你会感觉到好像
 Sometimes you feel like the referee is really bringing 
 裁判真的是拉低比赛的水平
 the game down. 
 我们希望今天这场比赛
 We hope that both sides will pay attention to the game 
 双方注意力都在比赛当中
 today. 
 打出一个高水准的对决
 Play a high level game. 
 说实话

 实力都
 Capital of Strength 
 非常强
 Very strong. 
 而且很有个性的球队
 A team with a lot of character 
 但这个第2阶段就是这种类似于

 淘汰赛制
 没有办法
 There is no way 
 谁让哥俩碰到一块
 Who let the two brothers meet? 
 之前我说大概15分钟以后
 I said maybe 15 minutes later. 
 局势会被国安控制
 The situation will be controlled by GuoAn. 
 鲁能进一个球
 Luneng scored a goal. 
 但是总体的趋势
 But the overall trend 
 应该是国安还是逐渐的控制
 Should it be GuoAn or should it be more controlled 
 比赛架炮
 play? 
 这个今天射门次数不少
 Thats a lot of shots today. 
 但好像
 But it seems. 
 命中门框以内的不多
 Not many hits in the frame. 
 这个球这是这是奥古斯托
 This ball
 this is Augusto. 
 这个球有失水准
 The ball is off the mark. 
 按说这个球实话说可能不在她
 It is not difficult to say that the ball may not be 
 的身体状态一点不难
 in her physical state. 
 真的一点不难
 Its really not difficult. 
 巴坎布剑姬很快这个球停在
 Bakambu quickly gets the ball behind him. 
 身后
 但马上交给插上的奥古斯托
 But let Augusto do it right away. 
 做
 做得还是很舒服的
 Its still very comfortable to do. 
 但奥古斯托
 But Augusto. 
 可能看到对方有后卫上来
 Might see a defender coming up for a shot. 
 急于抢射
 这个身体稍微有点靠后
 This body is a little bit back. 
 修到奥古斯托脚下

 李可争顶

 认为是一个国安队的界外球

 你看鲁能队三次射门

 而且两次全部打正取得一个进球
 And both times he scored a goal. 
 这又是一个阴伤的被动换人调整

 a cloudy injury.

 刘愚爱被这个
 Liu Yu loves this. 
 黄聪换下一样

 话
 很有可能对国内会会会可乘势而
 It is likely that the domestic games will be able to 
 上
 take advantage of the situation. 
 重视而上
 Attach importance to 
 而且还有一点倒倒霉在哪
 And a little bit of bad luck. 
 就是这个换人时间受伤的时间
 This is the time of the substitution. The time of the 
 是接近30分钟

 这30分钟实际上是什
 What are these 30 minutes really about? 
 就是替补队员在
 Its the substitutes. 
 还没有起来热身
 Havent warmed up yet. 
 一般可能替补队员在上半场可能
 Usually the substitutes will be up for 20 or 25 minutes 
 会20分钟或25分钟起来在
 in the first half. 
 热身
 但刚才我们看到佩莱是坐在替补
 But just now we saw Pelle sitting on the bench. 
 席上没起
 而这个时候如果替补席上坐30

 分钟
 等于前面的热身已经凉
 Equals the front of the warm-up has been cold. 
 对

 我看莫伊塞斯又站起来
 I saw Moises get up again. 
 奥古斯托
 Augusto 
 上一场比赛

 刘军帅跟

 1米8遇上1米69
 1.8 m met 1.69 m 
 不过鲁能我认为上半场比赛能够
 But I think Luneng can keep the score in the first 
 把这比分保持住
 half. 
 厄从战略角度来讲是可以的
 Well
 from a strategic point of view
 yes. 
 因为毕竟国安这个扳平比分之后
 Because
 after all
 after GuoAns equaliser 
 它这个攻势起来
 Its on the offensive. 
 对
 Yes 
 但是
 But 
 国安对左路的防守如果还是这样
 GuoAns defence on the left if it stays that way 
 那
 That 
 唉鲁能这个右路的进攻还会
 Well
 Lunengs attack on the right will be used. 
 有所利用
 因为基本上
 Because basically. 
 就是2打1
 Thats two for one. 
 前面50多
 More than 50 in the front 
 比赛开始阶段
 At the beginning of the game 
 实际上身体状况不好
 In fact
 he is not in good health. 
 而且防守的这个意识差一些
 And this defensive awareness is a little poor. 
 那就是左后卫
 Thats the left back. 
 李磊和左中卫于洋
 Li Lei and left-sided centre back Yu Yang 
 对面是段刘愚
 Opposite is Duan Liu Yu. 
 蒿俊闵加上莫伊塞斯
 Hao Junmin plus Moises 
 还有张弛
 And relaxation. 
 别在家or古斯托张翎脚下
 Not at home or at the feet of Gusteau. 
 又是一记冲天炮
 Its another shot in the eye. 
 这次整个竣工的酝酿应该说前期
 The whole completion of the gestation should be said 
 做的不错
 to have done well in the early stage. 
 张玉宁如果要打在门框以内
 If Zhang Yuning wants to hit the frame of the goal
 
 甭管进不进
 Dont worry about getting in. 
 让门将扑一下
 Let the goalkeeper dive. 
 其他队友可能不说什
 Other teammates may not say anything. 
 那你
 So
 you. 
 卡达尔传球收
 Kadar collects the pass. 
 求道别
 Bid Goodbye 
 脚下
 Underfoot 
 好久没骚扰
 Its been a long time. 
 这个别
 Dont do this. 
 感觉就是它要往哪转身
 The feeling is where its going to turn. 
 根本没什先兆推说
 Theres no premonition. 
 转就转说转就转
 Spin around. Spin around. 
 蒿俊闵交给莫伊塞斯
 Hao Junmin to Moises 
 快速转移到右侧
 Move quickly to the right. 
 张弛没能达到格德斯脚下
 Zhang Chi failed to reach the foot of the Guedes 
 格德斯拉边
 Guedes Laban 
 卡达尔将球传过来
 Kadar turns the ball in. 
 我刘云
 I
 Liu Yun. 
 段刘愚在右路还是相当活跃是
 Duan Liuyu is still quite active on the right. 
 但李霄鹏指导基本上是把它当
 But Li Xiaopengs guidance is basically to use it at 
 前腰来使用
 the current waist. 
 卡达尔打左路是不是有点别扭
 Is Kadar playing on the left a bit awkward? 
 看一看他跟郑铮是不是始终会
 See if he and Zheng Zheng will always be in this position. 
 这站位
 现在来讲他是有点不太适应
 He is a little uncomfortable now. 
 巴坎布巴坎布以前是深厚
 Bakambu Bakambu used to be deep. 
 经常有这个不错的
 This is a good one. 
 机会
 Opportunity 
 现在基本上单刀已经没有
 Now there is basically no single knife. 
 他为什不快乐
 Why isnt he happy? 
 是因为他没有单刀
 Because he didnt have a single weapon. 
 他的进球方式改变
 The way he scores goals changes 
 对方不给他插身后的机会是
 The other side doesnt give him a chance to get in 
 behind. 
 所以它更多的是变成门前抢点行
 So its more of a scramble in front of the door. 
 但今天首发的这两个前锋好像感觉
 But the two strikers who started today seem to have 
 巴坎布踢得要更丰富一些
 a bit more Bakambu 
 对
 Yes 
 就是他有时候会主动地为张玉
 That is
 he sometimes took the initiative to open up 
 宁去拉开空间拉开空间去
 space for Zhang Yuning. 
 甲泡或者是寻求传球
 Or looking for a pass. 
 裁判可能还是吹犯规
 The referee may still call a foul. 
 他认为对方有胳膊肘的动作
 A motion in which he thinks the opponent has an elbow. 
 奥古斯托躺在中圈里
 Augusto lies in the middle circle. 
 一个右手手臂的动作
 An action of the right arm. 
 古斯托曾经在德甲
 Gusteau was in the Bundesliga 
 勒沃库森效力过5个赛季

 公司还是很瘦
 still very thin to the company. 
 当然后防线的鲁能队的稳固住
 Of course Luneng at the back are solid. 
 没有丢球

 最后发射一搏奠定一定的

 这是
 This is 
 金兵灾突然轻挑到禁区内
 Jin Bing suddenly flicks into the penalty area. 
 这个球有点诡异
 This ball is a little weird. 
 中卫还冒顶
 The centre back is still heading. 
 球砸在巴坎布的脑袋上
 The ball hits Bakambu on the head 
 又出现问题
 Theres another problem. 
 这个王大雷鞋带开
 This Wang Dalei shoelace is open. 
 然后队友给记一下
 Then write it down for your teammates. 
 这确实得让队友帮忙
 It does have to be helped by team-mates. 
 如果他要摘手套
 If he wants to take off his gloves
 
 耽误的时间会更长
 The delay will be longer. 
 其实鲁能已经发现进攻
 In fact
 Luneng has found that the attack should be 
 就应该集结兵力在右路
 concentrated on the right. 
 因为张弛助攻能力比较强
 Because the ability of relaxation and assists is relatively 
 蒿俊闵习惯于在右路
 Hao Junmin is used to playing on the right. 
 再加上个段
 Plus a paragraph. 
 刘愚今天发挥的不错
 Liu Yu played well today.

 山东鲁能实际上表现出很强

 同时今天进入状态更早的

 其实就是5分多钟

 那应该说可能进攻的机会
 That should be said in terms of possible attacking 
 层面来说

 宾官稍微多一些
 There are a few more guests. 
 但上半场临近结束的时候
 But towards the end of the first half 
 伤鲁能是打出一拨自己的
 Injury Luneng is to play a number of their own momentum. 
 气势
 我感觉上像莫伊塞斯
 I feel like Moises. 
 金敬道的身体情况会不会成为下半场
 Will Jin Jingdaos physical condition become a little 
 的一点点隐患
 bit of a danger in the second half? 
 是这样
 Yes
 it is. 
 上半场模拟赛斯一次倒地
 Simulated Saiz going down once in the first half 
 甚至让费莱尼佩莱从替补席上
 Even get Feleinepelle off the bench. 
 坐起来
 我估计可能他的伤情球队是解
 I guess maybe his injury is the team solution. 
 有可能会有预案
 There may be a plan. 
 就是在不能支持的情况下
 Its when you cant support it. 
 马上佩莱就上场
 We have Pelle on the field right now. 
 其实郝伟这两场比赛咱们都
 In fact
 Hao Wei
 these two games we can see that it 
 可以看得出来是下功夫的笑
 is hard to laugh. 
 对
 Yes 
 下功夫
 Work Hard 
 而且他替补席上留一个后手
 And hes got a back on the bench. 
 就是佩莱

 一旦比分落后
 Once the score is down
 
 他肯定会上佩莱

 其实好像被激发出更大的一个
 In fact
 it seems to be inspired by a greater energy 
 能量和一个争胜的决心
 and a determination to win. 
 那天场面上有所体现
 On the scene that day. 
 是
 Yes 
 但今天国家队进入状态这慢
 But the national team is slow to get into shape today. 
 我觉得是不是有之前自信心太
 I think there is a reason why I was too confident before. 
 强的一个原因
 因为上一场比赛好像落后两
 Because it looked like wed come back from two goals 
 球打回来
 down last time. 
 球队可能会觉得咱们别停
 The team may think we dont stop. 
 接着踢是
 And then the kick. 
 可能会这想
 You might think that. 
 但是在休息几天之后再打比赛
 But to play after a few days off 
 我们看好吴伟已经将鲁能做
 We are optimistic that Wu Wei has made a new adjustment 
 一番新的调整
 for Luneng. 
 而国安对好像那种打回信心
 And GuoAn seems to have that confidence back. 
 还存在
 但是进入状态如此之慢
 But its so slow to get into shape. 
 在屡次左路被突袭之后
 After repeated raids down the left. 
 甚至在丢一个球以后
 Even after conceding a goal. 
 国安对才打起精神来
 The GuoAn was pumped up. 
 我觉得这个不是好事
 I Dont think this is a good thing. 
 另外一个就是123这一个点
 The other one is the point 123. 
 我觉得是国安队一个
 I think its Guoan. 
 潜伏的隐患
 Hidden Danger 
 有这个可能
 Its possible. 
 那我们一起来等待一下
 Lets wait for a while. 
 观察一下下半场比赛

 双方谁可能是犯错更少的一方

 谁是细节做得更好的一方

 第2回合1:2客场输给上海上
 Second leg 2-1 away to Shanghai SIPG 
 港
 国安队是全场紧逼
 Guoan is a full-court press. 
 其实张玉宁单打刘军帅没什
 In fact
 Zhang Yuning has no advantage over Liu Junshuai 
 优势
 in singles. 
 对
 Yes 
 因为从身体角度来讲
 Because from a physical standpoint
 
 刘军帅的
 Liu Jun Shuai 
 力量非常强
 Very powerful. 
 那巴坎布的速度灵敏
 The speed of the Bakambu is quick. 
 倒有可能给刘军帅带来一定的
 It may bring some difficulties to Liu Junshuai. 
 难度
 所以上半场那个国安队进球
 So that Guoan goal in the first half came from the 
 是来自于巴坎布突破刘军帅
 Bakambu to break through Liu Junshuai. 
 唉

 这个比赛如果你要把两回合看成

 its one game. 
 这个一场比赛
 你看鲁能先进两个球
 Look
 Luneng scored two goals. 
 关联又进两个群
 The association enters two more groups. 
 那接下来那个球是鲁能近
 Then Luneng is close to the next goal. 
 因为你连进三个球都
 Because you scored three goals in a row. 
 概率小一些
 Less likely. 
 现在国安又搬一个
 And now another in GuoAn. 
 那接下来这个事就不好说
 Then the next thing is hard to say. 
 你认为下一个进球就不好说
 Do you think the next goal will be hard to say? 
 这个球就不好说
 This ball is hard to say. 
 因为有你要说是鲁能近是可能
 Because it is possible for you to say that Luneng is 
 close. 
 下面可能会出现另外一种情况就是
 Another situation that may arise is that 
 可能国安现金
 Likely GuoAn Cash 
 可能鲁能进
 Maybe Lu can get in. 
 但国安扳平是
 But GuoAns equaliser was 
 对
 Yes 
 这个球感觉好像就剩就是就应该

 You have to pass the ball. 
 奥古斯托
 Augusto 
 我这技术是
 This is my technique. 
 这球要不打门要分边
 The ball has to be scored or not. 
 但是你看下半场的开场阶段
 But you look at the opening stages of the second half 
 奥古斯托拿球的状态和上半场的
 Augustos form on the ball was very different to the 
 开局阶段的差异就很大
 opening stages of the first half. 
 这个学校分到右路
 The school is on the right. 
 非常好
 Very nice 
 你看像队友适应马上
 You look like a teammate to adapt immediately. 
 对
 Yes 
 他觉得自己当时没有控制住
 He felt that he was out of control. 
 因为一般来讲
 Because generally speaking
 
 漂亮的过人摆脱之后
 After the beautiful people get rid of. 
 要想抑制住自己射门那种欲望是
 Its very difficult to keep down your desire to shoot. 
 非常难的一件事情
 是这样
 Yes
 it is. 
 就相当于这这肉上来
 Its the equivalent of this meat. 
 筷子已经拿起来
 The chopsticks have been picked up.

 最后能把它放下
 And finally put it down. 
 说领导还没讲话

 对
 Yes 
 这非常难
 Its very difficult. 
 是就是就像酒杯端起来
 Yeah
 just like a wine glass. 
 放嘴边再放下
 Put it down before you drop it. 
 太难
 Too Difficult 
 中国
 China 
 张玉宁这个球
 Zhang Yuning this ball. 
 于洋这个球传得非常不合理
 Yu Yangs pass is very unreasonable. 
 因为队友身边鲁能的球员已经
 Because Luneng players around their teammates are already 
 是虎视眈眈
 eyeing. 
 其实就是鲁能两个边后卫利用
 In fact
 Lunengs two full-backs really had a chance 
 好真的是有机会
 to make good use of it. 
 因为瞬间
 Because the moment. 
 守转攻的时候关对的
 On the turn from the defense to the offense. 
 因为两没有边前卫
 Because there are no wingers. 
 他就很难到落位到边路
 Hes struggling to get out wide. 
 此前几年施密特执教的时候
 The previous couple of years under Schmidt 
 他是不太用边前卫这样的决策
 He doesnt make decisions like wingers. 
 所以宋博轩
 So Song Boxuan 
 然后春明等等都离开球队
 Then Chunming and so on left the team. 
 而热内西奥上赛季最后带队达
 Genesio led the team for the final nine rounds of last 
 9轮的时候
 season. 
 他好像唉
 He seems to be. 
 很需要一个边前卫
 Need a wingman. 
 所以像王子铭
 So like Wang Ziming. 
 张玉宁都去打过边前
 Zhang Yuning went to the frontier. 
 但是如果它菱形站位
 But if its diamond-shaped
 
 那
 That 
 中场的两个边路势必宽度要
 The width of the two wings in midfield is bound to 
 稍微差一些
 be slightly worse. 
 就是为什说相对来讲
 That is
 why? Relatively speaking. 
 如果把李可放在左路防守会
 It would have been better to put Li Ke on the left. 
 好一些
 因为金兵灾在那边
 Because the Jin Bing disaster is over there. 
 对
 Yes 
 金兵在在那边
 Jin Bing is over there. 
 这个
 This 
 能够帮助奥古斯托能能防一
 Can help Augusto to defend? 
 防
 如果奥数奥古斯托到右路
 If Olympique Augusto goes to the right 
 但是显然这奥古斯托更愿意在
 But its clear that Augusto would prefer to be on the 
 左
 left. 
 因为他在左路她有内切
 Because he cuts inside her on the left. 
 你看
 You see 
 内切
 INCUT 
 唉然后再去选择传球的方向
 Alas
 and then to choose the direction of the pass. 
 这边张弛倒完球以后非常清晰
 This side is very clear after Zhang Chi finished the 
 非常可惜
 Its a pity. 
 队友的传球没有找到格德斯
 A pass from a team-mate fails to find the feet of Guedes 
 的脚下
 对
 Yes 
 格德斯就是几乎每一次队友没
 The Guedes is that almost every time a teammate doesnt 
 传好
 pass it well 
 他都要抱怨
 Hes gonna complain. 
 这个这个性格说实话
 Tell the truth about this character. 
 这就是看的是是一个对
 Thats what it looks like. Its a right. 
 可能或者是他有一定作用
 Maybe or maybe he has a role. 
 对
 Yes 
 然后奥古斯托已有一段时间
 Then Augusto has been so for some time now. 
 是如此是如此
 后来50多可能当队长
 Later
 more than 50 may be the captain. 
 觉得不好意思
 Feel embarrassed 
 国安队友时候局部太小的这种
 This kind of too fine cooperation when GuoAns teammates 
 太细的配合
 are too small. 
 往往是蕴含着这个隐患
 Often it contains this hidden danger. 
 你看
 You see 
 马上三个人抢张玉宁
 Three men robbed Zhang Yuning immediately. 
 张宁对莫伊塞斯第2次用手
 Zhang Ning used his hand on Moises for the second time. 
 场地
 Site 
 好像不是很好
 It doesnt look good. 
 一脚传球
 One pass. 
 一下雨这个有影响
 This is affected when it rains. 
 格德斯冲击力是相当强
 The Guedes impact is quite strong. 
 王刚一看见机不妙
 As soon as Wang Gang saw the opportunity
 it was not 
 赶紧捅出边线
 HURRY OUT OF THE LINE 
 这个
 This 
 卡达尔好像应该打过边后卫
 Kadar looks like he should have played wing-back. 
 你从他刚才掷界外球那份老练近
 You know
 from the touch he just threw the ball in. 
 他应该打过边后卫
 He should have played wing-back. 
 漂流这个好玩的好
 Drifting is good fun. 
 罚款不巴坎布像长身体
 Fine not Bakambu like long body. 
 这个传球笔直的
 The pass is straight. 
 找到对方的后卫
 Find the defender. 
 刚才是那时候的张弛
 That was the moment of relaxation. 
 他自己很泄气
 He was very discouraged himself. 
 他已经三脚没穿好
 He has three feet to wear. 
 第4脚不错
 The fourth foot is good. 
 这次是
 This time
 yes. 
 再次面对刘军帅
 Face Liu Junshuai again 
 然后直接射门
 And go straight for goal. 
 这场球输巴坎布的就这个就
 Thats it. Thats it. Thats a shot. 
 就这这叫射门
 就这角这个这个不传球
 Thats the corner. Thats not the pass. 
 射门可能得记一等罪
 Shooting may be a penalty. 
 就是这个球是
 This is the ball. 
 你看
 You see 
 他自己的眼神告诉我又做错
 His own eyes told me he was wrong again. 
 看场地的
 Venue _ looking 
 翻译给他
 Translate for him. 
 做一个6的手势
 Make a gesture of six. 
 不知道这个6是什意思

 国安队今天其实打得很谨慎就是
 Guoan actually played very cautiously today. 
 中后场的传导比较多
 There is more transmission in the middle and back court. 
 球速比较慢
 The ball speed is slow. 
 段刘愚传跑方向
 Duan Liu Yu Chuan Run Direction 
 没有一致
 No agreement. 
 就关对就是由守转攻速度太
 That is to say
 the speed from defense to attack is 
 慢
 too slow. 
 对
 Yes 
 那速度太慢
 Thats too slow. 
 蒿俊闵
 Hao Jun Min 
 格德斯前插
 Guedes forward interpolation 
 于洋拦一下
 Yu Yang stops it. 
 那卡达尔上来
 Na Kadar
 get up here. 
 这个球还是金兵灾的这个拦截
 This ball is still the interception of Jin Bing disaster. 
 蓝的线路非常的
 The Blue Line is very. 
 有的时候一些预判
 Sometimes some predict. 
 对他这脑子还真是挺拽的
 Yeah
 hes got a real brain. 
 它属于比较聪明的那种韩国人
 It belongs to the more intelligent kind of Korean. 
 你别看他个大
 Dont look at him. 
 就是有时候表达不太好
 I just dont express myself well sometimes. 
 他太聪明
 He is too clever. 
 有时候不好
 Sometimes not. 
 这个定位球给的可比较糟糕

 you say
 is no threat. 
 结果他非得犯规

 他隔着一米多就起跳
 He took off at a distance of more than one meter. 
 对
 Yes 
 龙龙你觉得
 Longlong
 do you think. 
 两支球队谁会做换人调整
 Who will make the substitutions between the two teams?

 刘军帅

 现在我认为我认为国安队得

 调整

 对
 Yes 
 就中场
 Midfield. 
 张玉宁身体

 谁来你扫一下

 世上费尔南多还是上张稀哲
 Fernando or Zhang Xizhe? 
 现在就是李可的作用
 Now is the role of Li Ke. 
 你不知道他要干什
 You dont know what hes up to. 
 就是你刚刚两端不清楚
 You just dont know both ends. 
 对
 Yes 
 你说这个奥古斯托跟别拉完
 You said this Augusto and Dont finish talking. 
 没谈
 不带他玩
 Dont play with him. 
 然后防守
 Then defense. 
 那边没什事
 Theres nothing going on there. 
 所以就是李可现在在场上
 So its Li Ke on the pitch now. 
 你还不如全中国在这
 You might as well have all of China here. 
 他还占个位置
 He still has a spot. 
 李可因为没有几乎没有一脚有
 Li Ke hardly had a creative pass because he didnt 
 创造性的传球
 have one. 
 他这个位置真的不清楚
 His position is really not clear. 
 公司都要启动
 The company has to start. 
 倒在禁区内
 Down in the box. 
 这叫射门
 Its called a shot. 
 打得不好
 Youre not playing well. 
 他想是可能是打一个突然袭击
 He thought it might be a surprise attack. 
 跑动当中突然什类似于脚尖
 Its like a toe in the middle of a run. 
 捅的那种
 王大雷
 Wang Da Lei 
 找段刘愚
 Find Duan Liu Yu 
 越位
 Offside 
 现在鲁能就办厂房
 Now Luneng will run the factory building. 
 对
 Yes 
 现在关键你仔细现在琢磨琢磨李磊
 Now the key is to think about it carefully. Li Lei 
 这边还有几次传中
 still has a few crosses here. 
 虽然说不太靠谱
 Its not very reliable. 
 但是王刚那边基本上
 But Wang Gang is basically there. 
 哑火
 Dumb Fire 
 就是传导太慢
 Its just too slow. 
 按照这样的比赛节奏
 At this pace of the game. 
 你你会想是不是双方约定贴
 Do you think if the two sides agree to put an overtime? 
 个加时
 反正体能都特别充沛
 Anyway
 they are very energetic. 
 咱们打个加时
 Lets play overtime. 
 唉
 Oh. 
 唉住哦天哪
 Oh
 stay. Oh
 my God. 
 不过我倒古斯托送一脚好球
 But I got a good one from Gusteau. 
 当然巴坎布站的非常好
 Of course Bakambu is very good. 
 奥普斯的意思是说就差一点点
 What opus means is that it was a close call. 
 是这意思
 Thats what it means. 
 就差一点点
 Just a little. 
 脚攻
 Foot _ attack 
 这个球你说倒地铲没什毛病
 Theres nothing wrong with the ball when you go down. 
 但是他没有打在脚攻上
 But he missed the foot shot. 
 它打在脚踝上还上
 It hit me on the ankle. 
 所以你看如果这个球这个球
 So you see if this ball is a threat. 
 形成威胁
 还有上面那个进球都是巴坎布
 And the above goal was scored by Bakambu and Augusto. 
 和奥古斯托瞬间的
 一对一人对
 One-to-one pair 
 它俩的一个变化
 A change in both of them. 
 回来你犯规次数可不少
 You got a lot of fouls coming back. 
 所以就是球员为什贵
 So what are the players for? 
 就在于他在那样的一个时刻
 Its in a moment like that. 
 他的个人能力要强于对手
 His individual ability is stronger than that of his 
 是的
 Yes 
 这球没守住
 The ball didnt hold. 
 唉唉没看清楚是谁碰出
 Oh
 I didnt see who touched it. 
 看到捂着头倒地
 And fell to the ground with his head covered. 
 这边裁判马上吹停比赛
 Here
 the referee stops the game immediately. 
 当时鲁能持球
 Luneng held the ball at that time. 
 是不是顶在腰上
 Is it on the waist? 
 两个人都是奔球去
 Both men are on the run. 
 但空中有剧烈的相撞
 But there was a violent collision in the air. 
 同时还有一个鲁能的后卫
 At the same time
 there is a Luneng defender. 
 古斯托右边路的起球
 Gustos kick from the right 
 球砸在张玉宁的头上
 The ball hit Zhang Yuning on the head. 
 两个人的腿在空中相撞

 行及可能费莱尼是提到门将

 还会有变化

 讲这个已经比赛不是在就是正常

 那对于山东鲁能全队其实以及
 That for Shandong Luneng team and fans. 
 球迷来说
 我觉得这场比赛还是留下

 不少的遗憾
 两回合其实郝伟指导的指挥和
 In fact
 Hao Weis guidance and all aspects of the 
 各方面都是非常得出色
 two rounds were very excellent. 
 但是下半时比赛我们看到70多
 But we saw more than 70 minutes in the second half. 
 分钟的时候段
 刘愚打入精彩的一球
 Liu Yu scored a wonderful goal. 
 京VR核定之后认定进球无效
 Beijing VR confirmed that the goal was invalid after 
 短短的几分钟之后
 Just a few minutes later. 
 张玉宁就反超比分
 Zhang Yuning overtook the score. 
 所以说可能这几分钟钟的时间就
 So it may take a few minutes to achieve a gap between 
 实现天上人间的一个差距
 heaven and earth. 
 有的时候足球比赛就是有这样的
 Sometimes in football there is such drama and difference. 
 戏剧性和差异是存在的
 接下来我们和两位老师一起来看
 Lets take a look at some of the highlights of the 
 一下下半时比赛的一些精彩瞬间
 second half with our two teachers. 
 下半场比赛双方对抗更加激烈
 In the second half
 the confrontation between the two 
 sides became more intense. 
 但是迟迟不换人
 But the replacement was delayed. 
 还有就是国安队并没有推进
 There is also the fact that Guoan did not advance the 
 这个比赛的节奏
 pace of the game. 
 这一点是让人疑惑
 This point is confusing. 
 奥古斯托这个突然间的一个变
 Augusto
 this sudden change of direction to the Bakambu. 
 向捅给巴坎布
 罚款不得把球打在立柱
 A fine must not hit the post. 
 是
 Yes 
 他这个球很有创造力是
 Hes very creative on the ball. 
 巴坎布其实插上很很不错
 It was a good move by Bakambu. 
 就这个您说可能只能是说
 You can only say that you have bad luck. 
 运气差一点
 唉这边小金子将球再次交给格
 Alas
 the little gold gives the ball to the Guedes 
 德斯
 again. 
 你看这王刚他甚至都看一眼
 Look at Wang Gang. He even looks at Duan Liu Yu. 
 段刘愚
 然后他仍然不去疯这个线路
 Then he still doesnt go crazy on this line. 
 而是仍往门前退
 But still back to the door. 
 就是我就真的
 Yes
 I am. I am. 
 VR认定就势格德斯这一角并
 VR decided that Guedes had not touched the ball in 
 没有碰到皮球
 the corner. 
 再来看一下
 Lets take another look. 
 实际上是离离李可的膝盖内侧
 Its actually off the inside of Ricos knee. 
 碰到球
 Touch the ball. 
 但是这个球咱们客观说
 But lets be objective about this ball. 
 就是说如果李可不倒
 That is to say
 if Lee doesnt fall
 
 这球就这样
 Thats it. 
 因为
 Because 
 因为和就势
 Because the peace is in order. 
 D不着球
 D no ball. 
 但是有一定的这个身体对抗对抗
 But it is very important to have a certain physical 
 的很重要
 confrontation. 
 不是很正常
 Its not normal. 
 但因为李可倒
 But because Li Ke Fa 
 所以我国就是韩国裁判可能就
 Therefore
 the referee in our country
 that is
 South 
 这这个张弛真是不应该
 Korea
 may be this
 this Zhang Chi really should not. 
 你说这这你说这何必

 Just a few very short minutes. 
 我们说上半场的两个进球在5
 We say the two goals in the first half took place within 
 分钟之内6分钟之内发生
 six minutes of each other. 
 而下半场一个进球被VR认定无效
 A goal in the second half was ruled out by VR. 
 然后马上国安对
 And then immediately GuoAn. 
 姚宇宁再入一球这个
 Yao Yuning scores another goal. 
 短时间内可能这种
 In a short period of time
 
 落差让队员的心态不太好
 The gap makes the mentality of the players not very 
 good. 
 再看
 Look again. 
 侯森
 Hou Sen 
 零这个球
 Zero. The ball. 
 费莱尼璃球身体有点远
 Fellainis glass ball is a little far. 
 射门的时候其实侯森已经把球
 Hou Sen had already held the ball when he shot. 
 抱住
 这我估计回去于洋身上可能都是
 I guess Yu Yangs body may be purple when I go back. 
 紫的
 我感觉抓对
 I feel right. 
 因为不可能不答
 Because its impossible not to answer. 
 但是肯定是宁强
 But it must be Ning Qiang. 
 金熙坤这个处理
 Jin Xikun
 this deal. 
 实际上我觉得是可以借鉴一下
 In fact
 I think we can learn from it. 
 双方各打50大板
 Each side will play 50 boards. 
 给黄牌处理
 Give a yellow card 
 张玉宁这个蛮搞笑
 Zhang Yuning
 this is very funny. 
 我觉得好像巴坎布把自己的精华
 I feel as if Bakambu has left the best of himself behind 
 留下来
 对
 Yes 
 他他想他说我回去把这个视频截
 He said he wanted me to cut out the video and send 
 出来发给发卡
 it to the hair card. 
 不像他致敬
 Not like him. 
 抱歉

 七脚打正
 Seven- footed correction 
 两个进球都是由张影完成

 对
 Yes 
 射门次数鲁能要少
 Luneng has fewer shots 
 命中
 Hit 
 门框以内的射门少不少
 A few shots on target 
 角球到15对5

 双方还是旗鼓相当的格局
 The two sides are still evenly matched. 
 黄牌3对2国安队友三张黄牌

 对于他来说的一场比赛

 不知道张一宁自己会去会不会回放

 自己的那一瞬间

 面对山东鲁能泰山

 张玉宁和巴坎布联袂首发

 这是稳定的组合

 在李芬刚刚落后不久

 张玉宁打入一球

 其实今天国内是有一些变化
 In fact
 there are some changes in China today. 
 对
 Yes 
 你比如说巴坎布的位置要更活
 For example
 Bakambus position should be more lively. 
 一些
 就是那个进进球
 That was the goal. 
 然后张弛的解围
 Then Zhang Chis clearance. 
 他他还low着劲
 Hes hes still low. 
 他搂着近
 He put his arm around him. 
 就是他觉得我别使太大劲
 Is that he thinks I dont need to push too hard. 
 我踢你身上
 I kicked you. 
 因为我使太大
 Because I made it too big 
 进门你好像我这人你看他

 他还不如玩命给饺子

 运气你说是运气

 说就是如果说这球他踢得快
 That is
 if he kicked the ball a little faster. 
 一点
 就像你说的近大点快一点
 Like you said
 closer
 faster. 
 或者出边线就完
 Or out on the sideline. 
 这东西没没法说
 This thing cant be said. 
 有的时候你就到极致

 你就像今天他那个进球被判无效

 那个球真是一个极致极致

 你说

 李可本身是着腰的

 我就说那逑李可不倒这个球不
 Ill say that Lee didnt tip the ball over and shouldnt 
 应该再吹犯规
 have blown for a foul. 
 即使没听着就
 Even if you dont listen. 
 但是恰恰可能因为李可倒倒
 But its just because Li Ke fell down. 
 之后
 这VR裁判可能他认为这个
 The VR referee may think that this is whether to recover 
 是是是不是夺回球
 the ball or not. 
 权的过程当中有问题
 There are problems in the process of power. 
 他倒之后他就在得起来
 After he collapsed
 he had to get up. 
 这个过程对防守肯定是有影响的
 This process certainly has an impact on the defense. 
 他要不倒

 这个球没事
 The ball is fine. 
 而且随后还打出来金敬道再创给
 And then also hit out Jin Jingdao to create such a 
 格德斯这样的一个过程
